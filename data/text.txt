The Post's Tamer El-Ghobashy gets an inside look at a race. (Video: Tamer El-Ghobashy, Joyce Lee/The Washington Post)Comment on this storyCommentGift ArticleShareZUBAYDIYA, Iraq — On a muddy berm on the edge of a wheat farm about 100 miles south of Baghdad, a dozen flatbed trucks carrying some $14 million in precious cargo slowly line up before dawn.At first light, men with sticks and hammers begin banging on the cages stacked on the back of the trucks — rousing 14,000 pigeons into a frenetic and unruly chorus of deep coos and grunts. Moments later, at the blast of an air horn, the cages are opened in unison and the birds take flight, the force of 28,000 wings generating gusts of wind as the pigeons hurtle in a single direction: to Baghdad. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightSix months of practice runs and strict conditioning culminate in a launch that lasts less than a minute. But the birds carry with them the hopes of men who have spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours training them.AdvertisementThese are the highflying pigeon races of Iraq.From October to March, when Iraq’s winter temperatures climb down from the triple digits of the summer, thousands of Iraqis race their pigeons in contests that can stretch as far as 600 miles, from Mosul in the north to Basra in the south, competing for bragging rights, modest purses and the satisfaction of knowing they raised a champion.Elite birds, which can fly up to 90 mph, are much sought after, with racing pigeons from a coveted European lineage costing $4,000. One such bird sold at auction for $93,000 in Basra.A stable of pigeons usually numbers between 50 and 100, with each prize bird requiring about $100 worth of feed, vitamins, herbal teas and omega-3 supplements per racing season to maintain peak fitness.Pigeon racing, a sport on the decline in the United States and Europe, where it was developed, is taking off in Iraq. After nearly 20 years of conflict in the country, the rising popularity of pigeon racing is a signal that “our people want to practice peace,” said Kamil Khinyab, the 52-year-old undisputed godfather of pigeon racing in Iraq. It is a peace that comes high above the perpetual gridlock, heavily armed soldiers and chaos of Baghdad’s streets. In their rooftop pigeon lofts, the hobbyists are in total control.Advertisement“If your pigeon wins, it’s only because of your efforts. If it loses, it’s because you need to do better raising it,” Khinyab said with a smirk. The ranks of the pigeon fanciers include medical doctors, academics, high-level military, police, intelligence service officers and engineers. These are prestige professions, and judging from the investment required, this is not a sport for the riffraff.But the racers have long been stigmatized as scoundrels.They are known locally as “matyarchi.” At best, they’re regarded as loners who waste their life doting on a bird that lacks any prestige. At worst, they’re suspected of being perverts who use their high-perched pigeon lofts to spy on neighbors or sneak a peek at the woman next door hanging laundry. One saying in Iraq goes, “Never trust the testimony of a matyarchi.” When someone looks to the sky furtively, others often inquire: “What’s wrong with you? You have the eyes of a matyarchi.”AdvertisementThe term itself drips with contempt. The Arabic suffix “chi” is generally reserved for bad habits and jobs of low social status. In Iraq, an excessive drinker is an “arakchi.” A gambler is known as a “qamarchi,” while the guy who fixes flat tires is “bancharchi.”But Khinyab and his community of pigeon fanciers say they’re engaging in a cerebral and competitive gentleman’s sport. “What makes someone successful at this hobby is intelligence above all — then care and mercy for the birds, which Iraqis have in abundance,” he said.From obsession to careerKhinyab knows what he’s talking about. He revolutionized the sport in Iraq.An engineer by training, he came to racing in 1999 when a friend showed him how a pigeon, just 3 months old, could find its way home from 140 miles away. “I was fascinated with how intelligent they were, and I fell in love,” he said.AdvertisementHe asked his friend and a cousin who also raised pigeons to give him a few birds to train, and he set up a rooftop coop, building high walls around it to protect his reputation. Khinyab collected 23 birds, paying 210,000 dinars for one he was sure would be a perennial winner. Back then, that sum could furnish an entire house or buy a reliable car.“I faced a lot of criticism from my family, but I’d show them [European] magazines where they listed pigeons worth $5,000 and $10,000.” His early results didn’t help his cause. During training sessions, all 23 of his pigeons flew away and never returned.Despite the costly blunder, Khinyab rebuilt his stable. He learned the key was to launch the pigeons close to their loft at first, until they reliably returned home, and then gradually increase the distance over time.What started as an obsession has now turned into a career. He runs Baghdad’s best-known pigeon club — a place that sells antifungal and anti-worm solutions, vitamins and other imported products needed to raise the fastest, strongest and smartest pigeons. It is also a gathering place for pigeon fanciers, a must stop for visitors from other provinces keen on learning the latest tradecraft.AdvertisementOn a recent evening, Khinyab presided over a boisterous gathering of competitors who had come to register their pigeons for a race the next day. As male and female birds were separated to prevent unwanted breeding, the owners exchanged warm greetings with hugs and kisses, referring to one another with the honorific “Champion.”“It’s competitive,” Khinyab said. “But there’s also a deep brotherhood among the participants.” Modernizing the racesIn pigeon racing, the birds are launched together, and then each bird flies to its home. Back in the day, owners would track their pigeons by tearing a dinar note in half, so that each half showed the same serial number, and then affixing one half to a pigeon’s leg and giving the other to a judge. The owners would wait at home for their birds to arrive, then grab the pigeon’s half of the dinar note and furiously drive to a club and check in with the judges. AdvertisementIt was woefully imprecise. Racers whose lofts were closest to the club were almost always declared the winner.Khinyab devised a better system. He divided a map of Baghdad into districts, and judges were assigned to locations within a mile of all the lofts in their district. The new system was quickly embraced by fellow racers.But it took the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein to bring the races into the modern era. The country, which had been cut off by sanctions and government corruption, was flooded with imports of all types. Amid the new marvel of cellphones and the myriad brands of blue jeans, there was now a possibility to import computer devices known as Bricon machines, invented in Belgium for the sole purpose of pigeon racing. Pigeons could be outfitted with a leg ring containing their registration number, and it would be digitally recorded when they reached their loft.AdvertisementKhinyab brought thousands of the devices to Iraq, and interest in the sport soared.Breeders vs. banditsJust as pigeon racing has exploded in popularity, so too has the practice of kidnapping prize birds for ransom. One village, located along the Baghdad-to-Basra Grand Prix route, has become infamous.Young men and boys wait on the edges of the village, Talihah, until they spot flocks of birds flying toward their destination. Using sticks, stones and pieces of barbed wire, the would-be kidnappers try to bring down the birds without killing them. Most owners attach their phone number to their birds’ legs. The pirates call and demand a sum of about $20 to $30 or mobile phone credits.Along Talihah’s muddy, unpaved roads, the bandits are unapologetic. Asked whether the village is indeed known for pigeon piracy, Hussein, a 32-year-old shopkeeper, proudly responded, “It’s true!”Advertisement“If they manage to cross our village safely, they’re in the clear,” added 19-year-old Wissam. “This is the most dangerous place for them.”Sattar Dayekh, a 40-year-old pigeon breeder who lives in the village, doesn’t condone the banditry, but he said he understands why his neighbors commit it.“These are poor kids looking to make some money,” he said. “If the racers don’t pay them, they’d stop hunting them. Besides, they can afford it.”Winners' spoilsA few days after the Zubaydiya race, Khadim Hamid, a 49-year-old who owns a welding shop, was taking stock of his racing pigeons. All 50 made it home, but none had broken into the top 10 — the benchmark for a good run. Though his home is stacked with trophies, the latest result bothered him.“To be a winner, you should know what your bird needs only by looking at it and provide it for it,” he grumbled.Race purses are never more than $100 or $200 for a first-place finish. The real money comes in raising champions and selling them to other racers for breeding.And then there’s the sheer satisfaction of bragging rights. Pigeon owners spend the six months ahead of the racing season chirping about how they are the best.“When the season comes, there’s no bigger pleasure than shutting them up,” Hamid said.So he said he was contemplating spending a little more money to renovate his loft, which sits atop his two-story house in a leafy neighborhood of Baghdad. It would run him about $4,000.In Iraq, the market for ‘distinguished’ cellphone numbers has prices that rival those at gold and gem exchanges.Baghdad gets its groove back: Violence is receding and Iraq’s capital is partying againToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the worldLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign newsComment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...TOP STORIESThe DownloadStay up to date on the news from Silicon Valley, and how to take back control of your data and devices.What to know as Elon Musk’s rocky deal with Twitter heads to courtGoogle CEO says company will slow hiring amid economic conditionsSinking FTC workplace rankings threaten Chair Lina Khan’s agendaRefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferencesCompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperPublic NoticesContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices

LozanoMarch 19, 2019 at 7:32 p.m. EDTCharlie Tamez and his wife, Dalia Tamez, eat at Ken's Restaurant Tuesday as the chemical fire at Intercontinental Terminals Company continues to send dark smoke over Deer Park, Texas. (Melissa Phillip/AP)Comment on this storyCommentGift ArticleShareHOUSTON — Officials said Tuesday they’re not sure when a two-day-old fire at a Houston-area petrochemical storage facility will burn itself out, but they expressed confidence that the air quality is safe despite huge plumes of smoke.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said at a news conference that monitors show the levels of contaminants in the air are safe and that the plume coming from the site in Deer Park, southeast of Houston, is reaching at least 4,000 feet and staying high enough that the air quality at ground level is safe.“It’s understandable why people would be scared,” said Hidalgo, the county’s top administrator. “We’re sharing information with the public so that everybody knows what we know, what we’re doing and where we’re headed.”The plume could carry particulates as high as 6,200 feet, officials said, but fog is forecast for the area Wednesday morning and could drag the plume downward, making the air quality more hazardous.Advertisement“We’re prepared for any contingency,” Hidalgo said.The fire that began Sunday at the Intercontinental Terminals Company (ITC) remained intense enough Tuesday to create its own micro weather system, causing shifting winds in the area, officials said.The head of the county’s health department, Dr. Umair Shah, said “there continues to be low risk to our community,” but vulnerable groups such as the elderly and pregnant women should be cautious.The company said Tuesday that five petrochemical tanks at the site were still burning, three others that had been on fire had burned out, and two tanks that didn’t have anything in them had collapsed.Firefighters are using water and foam to try to prevent the blaze from spreading to five other tanks.A drop in water pressure allowed the fire to intensify overnight and spread to two additional tanks, but the pressure later normalized, authorities said.AdvertisementThe tanks contain components of gasoline and materials used in nail polish remover, glues and paint thinner.Officials previously said the fire could have burned itself out by Wednesday, but they scrapped that timetable on Tuesday.ITC spokeswoman Alice Richardson said the company was “working our hardest to get this current incident under control.”“Of course ITC is very sorry. . . . This isn’t an event we wanted,” a teary-eyed Richardson said during a news conference Tuesday.The school districts in Deer Park and in nearby La Porte canceled classes Monday but reopened Tuesday, albeit with restrictions on outdoor activities.— Associated Press Associated Press writer David Warren in Dallas contributed to this report.Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...TOP STORIESThe BriefingDon’t miss reporting and analysis from the Hill and the White House.Biden weighs breaking climate pledges to win Manchin’s support on billWho is Patrick Byrne, former Overstock CEO and election denier?Meet the lonely Democrat who thinks his party can win in 2022RefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferencesCompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperPublic NoticesContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices

Joe Biden The week in whoppers: Samantha Bee's incitement, the NYT's blatant bias and more Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is calling for tax hikes to help fund New York City’s cash-strapped schools and child care programs. “I’m calling on Mayor [Bill] de Blasio and Governor [Andrew] Cuomo to raise revenue to fund universal child-care programs, significantly increase staffing at schools, and fund the infrastructure improvements, including ventilation, that our school buildings need to be safe,” Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said in a statement Wednesday. The Bronx Democrat said her tax hike call comes after hearing complaints from parents and teachers in her district that schools are not ready to reopen because of COVID-19 safety issues. “It’s clear that there’s significant evidence to suggest that schools are not safe to re-open,” she said. “Poorly ventilated and unsanitized classrooms, ambiguous or ineffective health screening, COVID testing and contact tracing protocols, and severe staffing shortages, on top of COVID cases in at least 55 schools, all indicate we are not ready to re-open.” She also rapped de Blasio for pushing a city budget in June that slashed more than $700 million from schools “but cut almost nothing meaningful from NYPD.” AOC also claimed the state still owes the New York City public school system $3.9 billion in funding from prior years. Ocasio-Cortez’s bid to raise taxes to fund education and child care comes as her Democratic socialist allies plot to take over the City Council next year by backing a slate of candidates for 35 open seats. Her tax hike campaign also comes as both the city and state grapple with multibillion-dollar shortfalls caused by the severe pandemic-fueled recession, resulting in massive job losses and plummeting tax revenues. see also New York's sales tax revenue down 7.8 percent due to COVID-19 Absent a federal bailout package, de Blasio has called on Albany to approve a $5 billion borrowing package for the city over two years to prevent a threatened 21,000 layoffs of municipal workers and preserve basic services. But Cuomo has resisted calls to hike taxes on the wealthy, saying it would make New York uncompetitive with other states. The combined state-city 12.6 percent income tax rate on the wealthy in New York City is higher than the new 12 percent income tax rate imposed on the rich in New Jersey. Most city tax rates, including on income and sales, must be cleared by the state Legislature and the governor. The mayor and council have authority to raise local property taxes. AOC was undeterred. “We are in this situation because we have balanced our budgets on the backs of students for decades,” said the congresswoman, who represents parts of The Bronx and Queens. She applauded city instructors for toiling to provide the best education possible “with very few resources.” “They deserve all of our gratitude and appreciation, but they also deserve the resources they need to succeed. Our kids and communities deserve for us to get this right.” Share this article: FacebookTwitter Flipboard WhatsAppEmailCopy Filed under Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez public schools taxes 9/23/20 Read Next Cops make arrest tied to burning body found on Hutchinson ... what to shop now The JW Pei bag stars love is on sale for Amazon Prime Day 2022 It's not too late!

More Share ✕ Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook LinkedIn LinkedIn Whatsapp Whatsapp Email Email Greg Nash Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) on Saturday signaled support for President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to fill the Supreme Court vacancy opened by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The North Carolina lawmaker, who is embroiled in a tight reelection battle, argued the situation following Ginsburg’s death is different from 2016, when the Senate GOP blocked President Obama from filling a vacancy on the court in an election year, because the government then was divided. “Four years ago, a Supreme Court vacancy arose under divided government and a lame-duck president as Americans were choosing his successor. Today, however, President Trump is again facing voters at the ballot box and North Carolinians will ultimately render their judgment on his presidency and how he chooses to fill the vacancy,” he said in a statement. “There is a clear choice on the future of the Supreme Court between the well-qualified and conservative jurist President Trump will nominate and I will support, and the liberal activist Joe Biden will nominate and Cal Cunningham will support, who will legislate radical, left-wing policies from the bench,” he added, referring to former state Sen. Cal Cunningham (D), his opponent in the Senate race. Sens. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), who are also facing tough reelection fights, made similar remarks Friday. Polls currently show Tillis narrowly trailing Cunningham in the Tarheel State’s Senate race, and he has sought to shore up support from skeptical conservatives by aligning himself closely with the president. The comments follow statements from both Trump and McConnell vowing to push forward on a potential nominee to replace Ginsburg. “We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices. We have this obligation, without delay!” Trump tweeted Saturday. “Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise,” McConnell said in a Friday night statement. “President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.” The GOP’s insistence has already infuriated Democrats who pointed to McConnell’s efforts to block Merrick Garland from receiving a confirmation hearing in 2016 after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, accusing the GOP of implementing a double standard. “Thom Tillis just surrendered whatever semblance of credibility and self-respect he had left and gave it Mitch McConnell on a silver platter,” said American Bridge 21st Century spokesperson Zach Hudson. “Now that his party is in control of the White House, Thom Tillis is hypocritically violating the same standard he set on Supreme Court vacancies 4 years ago. Thom Tillis will say and do anything to salvage his sinking ship of a political career and North Carolina voters can’t trust a single thing he says.” Tags Death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg Donald Trump Joe Biden Kelly Loeffler Martha McSally Merrick Garland Mitch McConnell Ruth Bader Ginsburg Supreme Court vacancy Thom Tillis The Hill has removed its comment section, as there are many other forums for readers to participate in the conversation.

Momentum is building to stop it. C.J. Ciaramella | 2.26.2019 8:30 AM Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on RedditShare by emailPrint friendly versionCopy page URLMedia Contact & Reprint Requests Junfu Han/TNS/Newscom In 2017, Michigan police seized property from nearly 1,000 people who were never convicted of a crime. Some of them were never even arrested. Those numbers—the result of new reporting requirements passed by the state in 2015—have spurred a bipartisan push among Michigan lawmakers to further restrict the practice of civil asset forfeiture, which allows police to seize cash and property suspected of being connected to criminal activity, even if the owner is never convicted, or sometimes never charged, with a crime. The Michigan Senate passed a civil asset forfeiture reform bill last week that would require police to obtain a criminal conviction to seize assets valued under $50,000, or consent from the owner to relinquish the property. The bill is now being considered by the state house. Jarrett Skorup, a researcher at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank, used a public records request to get the underlying data the state used to prepare its annual reports. Skorup's data showed that in 2017, the latest year for which information is available, Michigan police seized $13 million in cash and property—everything ranging from guns to TVs to Playstation 4s to grow lights for marijuana. Bowling balls, jumper cables, power tools, and Beats headphones also made the list. Those spreadsheets also showed that police, particularly in Wayne County, Michigan, seized thousands of cars in 2017 under the auspices of marijuana enforcement. Of the more than 2,500 vehicles seized, 473 were not accompanied by a criminal conviction, and in 438 of those cases, no one was even charged with a crime, according to Skorup's data. In 10 cases, the cars were seized under suspicion of a drug violation, even though the records say police didn't find any drugs. "The vehicles are worth very little, typically around $1,000 or $2,000," Skorup says. "These are very likely low-income people, people that can't afford to sit around without a vehicle for three weeks or afford an attorney to go challenge it." Wayne County prosecutors typically offer to settle such forfeiture cases and return the owner's car for a $900 payment. The alternative is paying out-of-pocket to hire an attorney and fight the forfeiture case, which in many cases would likely exceed the estimated worth of the car. The Wayne County Sheriff's Office reported in 2016 that it surveilled 32 medical marijuana dispensaries, performed 634 investigatory stops of cars leaving dispensaries, and impounded 467 vehicles as part of Operation Push-Off, a local law enforcement initiative targeting drugs, prostitution, and drag racing funded by licensing fees collected from the state's medical marijuana program. It all adds up to big money for local law enforcement. According to state reports, Wayne County law enforcement received $473,256 in Medical Marihuana Operation and Oversight Grants in fiscal year 2016 and $483,132 in 2017. As Reason reported, Wayne County's asset forfeiture program is now the subject of a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by a woman whose car was seized after Wayne County Sheriff's deputies found $10 worth of marijuana in it. The suit claims the seizure and settlement fee were a violation of the Eighth Amendment's protections against excessive fines and fees. (The Supreme Court unanimously ruled earlier this week, in the case of Indiana man challenging the forfeiture of his Land Rover, that the Eighth Amendment applies to states.) Michigan law enforcement is pushing back against the reform efforts. Testifying at a House committee hearing on the proposed legislation this week, Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police executive director Robert Stevenson said it would essentially subject police to a higher standard than many other areas of government. "The federal government can seize your money for tax evasion without a criminal conviction," Stevenson told lawmakers. "Geoffrey Fieger has made a very good living seizing people's money without any type of conviction. The state of Michigan can seize your property without a conviction. Any of you can go to small claims court today and get an order to seize somebody's else's property without a conviction." But others in the state who have watched the practice expand support the bill, such as Ted Nelson, a now-retired Michigan State Police officer who used to train police across the state on how to use civil asset forfeiture. When Nelson was training law enforcement, he says he emphasized that civil asset forfeiture was supposed to be used only against the direct proceeds of illegal drug sales, and that money was supposed to only fund narcotics enforcement. Two changes to Michigan law, Nelson says, "opened the floodgates" for civil asset forfeiture in the state. in 2008, Michigan legalized medical marijuana, and police began zealously going after violators—and their property, no matter how loosely connected to drug sales—for forfeiture. Then in 2011, Michigan removed the requirement that forfeiture revenue only fund narcotics enforcement, allowing it to be used for general police budgets with minimal oversight. "Going around the state and listening to people, [police] were seizing things like money out of birthday cards and lawnmowers, which to me went against the proceeds aspect," Nelson says. "To me, it's not the same thing." In one case, Nelson says police seized a man and woman's property because their son was growing marijuana close to their house. "It led [police] to push the law to the edges of what they could do," Nelson continued. "It could be easily abused, and it was being stretched as far as it could possibly be stretched." According to Skorup's data, for instance, the Wayne State University Police Department seized $9 in cash in a 2017 case that never resulted in a criminal conviction. The Roseville Police Department seized $5 and a cell phone in another case that ultimately did end in a conviction. While the reporting requirements passed in Michigan in 2015 track what police departments seize, it doesn't track what they spend it on. The head prosecutor of Macomb County, Michigan, is currently under scrutiny from county officials after a public records lawsuit revealed more than $100,000 in questionable expenditures, including using forfeiture funds for office furniture, birthdays, and retirement parties. More than half of all states have passed some form of asset forfeiture reform in the past decade. Police have often opposed those reforms, saying asset forfeiture is a vital tool to disrupt drug trafficking. Skorup says that, while there are large seizures that net huge amounts of cash, the data shows that it's used most often against petty amounts of money and people who have few resources to defend themselves, rather than El Chapo. Of the total 2,078 cash seizures by Michigan law enforcement in 2017, the median value was $396, and the average value was $2,042. Overall, Michigan police seized $1.7 million in cash that was not accompanied by a criminal conviction. "If you look at these files, we're not talking about a couple of flashy cases," he says. "We're talking about hundreds and hundreds of people that are never charged, or even hundreds more where they're charged, found not guilty, and the law enforcement proceeds with the forfeiture anyways."

A child wearing a mask rubs in his hand sanitizer. Getty Images KEY FACTS Households with children under 18 living at home are more likely to have lost jobs and income: Heads of household lost their jobs in 12.9% of homes with children compared to 9.2% of childless homes, the study found. They’re also more likely to have missed rent or debt payments: 19.5% of households with children said they skipped a rent, mortgage, auto loan, credit card or student loan payment compared to 12.5% of households without. Families with kids are also more likely to rely on external support like unemployment benefits, food stamps and food banks, and financial support from family and friends. This reliance is even higher among single-parent, nonwhite households and households in low-income neighborhoods, the researchers found. All this, of course, is only compounded by the added burdens of virtual schooling and closed childcare facilities that working parents and caretakers must contend with. Big number 39%. That’s the portion of households with children that reported income losses, compared to 30.8% of households without. Crucial quote “Our results reveal high reliance by [households with children], and especially those headed by a single parent, on food and financial support from social networks as well as government assistance in the form of Snap and unemployment benefits since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the researchers wrote. “While a greater reliance on assistance undoubtedly predates the pandemic, the high rates of job and income loss experienced by households with children has clearly heightened the importance of such support.” Key background Several key benefits of the Cares Act have expired—most notably supplemental unemployment benefits and eviction protections for certain renters—but the Trump Administration and top Democratic lawmakers have been unable to come to an agreement on what the next round of federal stimulus legislation should look like. The $3 trillion Heroes Act, passed by the Democrat-led House in May, included additional support for federal unemployment and nutrition assistance, along with another round of direct stimulus payments and hazard pay for essential workers. The Republican-led Senate never took up the bill, though it did release its own plan—the Heals Act—last month. When Democratic lawmakers and White House policymakers were unable to reach a compromise last week, President Trump took executive action over the weekend with respect to enhanced unemployment benefits, student loans, eviction protections and a payroll tax deferment. Those actions alone, however, aren’t likely to be as effective in propping up the economy as would legislation from Congress.

Matt Rourke/AP hide caption toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Letter carrier Henrietta Dixon, a nearly 30-year veteran, sorts mail to be delivered before she sets out on her route in Philadelphia in May. Changes within the U.S. Postal Service could make some deliveries late. Matt Rourke/AP On his first day on the job last month, new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy addressed the nearly half-million U.S. Postal Service career employees in a video message. He talked of a "trajectory for success" and said that "we will focus on creating a viable operating model that ensures the Postal Service continues fulfilling its public service mission." That message has since been followed by a number of directives and orders that prompt some to wonder just what DeJoy has in mind for the agency, which dates back to the nation's earliest days. DeJoy, the nation's 75th postmaster general — a line that stretches back to Benjamin Franklin — is a major donor to President Trump and other Republicans. He previously headed a North Carolina-based logistics company. Politics Election Officials Worry Postal Changes Could Affect Voting By Mail Managers have told postal workers that under DeJoy, the post office is about to embark on what's been called a long-overdue "operational pivot." It means that among other things, late-arriving mail will now be left behind by carriers and delivered the next day. Overtime will be eliminated. Those moves upset some workers, who take seriously the unofficial motto of the Postal Service that holds: "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds" — a phrase from the Greek historian Herodotus chiseled into the granite of New York City's general post office. "There seems to be a sea change here," says Philip Rubio, a history professor at North Carolina A&T State University and a former letter carrier. Rubio says DeJoy seems intent on making the Postal Service more of a business than a service. "If they're talking about delaying mail, if they're talking about sending letter carriers out to the street, even if the truck is late, that means there's a lot of first-class mail that's going to be left on the workroom floor. And there's an almost cavalier attitude about this," Rubio says. Enlarge this image Louis DeJoy, pictured in 2017, became the nation's 75th postmaster general last month. DeJoy's plans for the Postal Service have generated controversy. Kim Walker/AP hide caption toggle caption Kim Walker/AP Louis DeJoy, pictured in 2017, became the nation's 75th postmaster general last month. DeJoy's plans for the Postal Service have generated controversy. Kim Walker/AP Agency in difficulty The Postal Service, which doesn't receive any tax dollars for its operating expenses, has longstanding financial issues. It reported a loss of nearly $9 billion last year. Some of that is due to a congressional mandate that the post office prepay the health care costs of retirees. Some of it is due to a years-long decline in the volume of first-class mail. The coronavirus pandemic has also meant a reduction in some mail. But it also meant an increase in package shipping as people shop online from their homes. That has postponed an imminent cash crisis the Postal Service had predicted might strike earlier this summer. National Postal Service Tests Changes To Mail Delivery System In 200 Cities Trump has frequently criticized the Postal Service, charging that it gives favorable deals to online retailers such as Amazon, whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Washington Post, another target of Trump's ire. Actually, a government study found, e-commerce package deliveries are profitable for the Postal Service — although not sufficient to offset the decline in other types of mail. Now, shippers who use the Postal Service aren't certain what the changes DeJoy is implementing will mean for their businesses. Art Sackler is manager of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, a group of companies that rely on the post office, including Amazon, Hallmark and others. Consider This from NPR Voting By Mail Will Increase Dramatically This Year — And It Could Get Messy "Having a potentially material change," Sackler says, "without any kind of consultation is a disappointment and hopefully was just, you know, a mistake or a mix-up." Sackler says that "it looks as if what they're proposing has the potential to delay mail," and that the delayed mail will accumulate. The unions representing Postal Service employees say they haven't met with DeJoy or been consulted about the changes either. Postal Service vs. "postal business" Enlarge this image Donna DeWitt at work at the U.S. post office for Isle au Haut, Maine, where she serves about 70 customers.

Bukaty/AP Donna DeWitt at work at the U.S. post office for Isle au Haut, Maine, where she serves about 70 customers. Advocates worry about losing the service in becoming a business. Robert F. Bukaty/AP Mark Dimondstein, president of the 200,000-member American Postal Workers Union, says the union is "absolutely opposed to any policies that just slow down the mail in the name of whatever the name is — cost cutting. In this case, it's about service. It's not the 'United States postal business.' It's the United States Postal Service." Dimondstein says the changes could have real-world consequences, including, he says, delays in delivering medicine, census forms — and even mail-in ballots, adding the notion of leaving mail behind "runs counter to everything" postal workers believe. One postal worker, who asked not to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR of a pharmaceutical company that had complained of delays in picking up its outgoing shipments. 2020 Election: Secure Your Vote Signed, Sealed, Undelivered: Thousands Of Mail-In Ballots Rejected For Tardiness "I am sick to my stomach," the worker said. "How can the United States Postal Service deny the pickup of outgoing mail for any customer — let alone a pharmaceutical company that is mailing medication?" This worker said the Postal Service used to take pride that every piece of mail went out by the end of the day. Now, the worker says, that's changed, adding: "It's crazy." For its part, the Postal Service says it is developing a business plan "to ensure that we will be financially stable and able to continue to provide dependable, affordable, safe and secure delivery of mail and packages to all Americans as a vital part of the nation's critical infrastructure." In addition, the Postal Service says that "by running operations on time and on schedule, we will enhance our ability to be sustainable so that we can continue to provide high-quality, reasonably priced service to all people and businesses in the country."

The hearing, which is scheduled for 9 a.m. ET before the Republican-led panel, will mark DeJoy's first time directly answering questions from Congress about the post office, which has come under intense scrutiny in the runup to the 2020 presidential election."I am pleased to have secured an oversight hearing on Friday with Postmaster General DeJoy in order to address urgent questions on the Postal Service delays that are causing massive disruptions across the country," Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement Tuesday."As Ranking Member on the only Senate Committee with oversight of the Postal Service, I will continue pressing for answers on Mr. DeJoy's recent directives and their impacts on all Americans, who rely on the Postal Service for prescriptions, running their small businesses, voting and other crucial purposes."DeJoy's cost-cutting measures at the ailing government agency reportedly include crackdowns on making late delivery trips and cuts to overtime pay and have led to claims of widespread mail delays.Democrats have raised concerns that the changes made by DeJoy, a major donor to Republicans and committees supporting President Donald Trump's reelection, could impact the November election, where the coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead more Americans than ever before to cast their ballots by mail.DeJoy has also come under fire for his business investments, which some Democrats say could pose conflicts of interest. CNN reported last week that DeJoy continues to hold at least $30 million in holdings in his former company XPO Logistics, which is a United States Postal Service contractor. The New York Times, citing financial disclosure forms, reported on Monday that Dejoy received $1.2 million to $7 million in income last year from XPO Logisitics.DeJoy was selected in May by the USPS Board of Governors, all of whom were appointed by Trump. DeJoy is reportedly the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who has not been a career employee of the agency.Trump has repeatedly railed against so-called universal mail-in voting, claiming without evidence that it will lead to massive fraud and a "rigged" election. He has drawn a distinction between absentee voting — a system he has reportedly utilized as president — and the efforts by some governors to send out ballots to all eligible voters. At the White House on Tuesday, Trump claimed again that widespread mail-in voting will lead to "a disaster the likes of which our country has never seen.""It'll end up being a rigged election or they will never come out with an outcome. They'll have to do it again," Trump said. "And nobody wants that, and I don't want that."Polls show Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to vote for president by mail, according to a recent Change Research/CNBC poll of likely voters in battleground states.A spokesman for Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., cheered the announcement of the hearing. "I am pleased that immense pressure from Senate Democrats and the American people have forced Senate Republicans to confront Postmaster General DeJoy's ongoing sabotage of the Postal Service that threatens the integrity of our elections and delays vital services," Schumer said in a statement.Schumer on Monday had pushed Johnson to schedule a hearing with DeJoy after the House Oversight Committee, led by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., announced that the postmaster general would testify before her panel next week.Robert Duncan, chairman of the USPS board, which selected DeJoy in May, will also testify before the House committee.Peters was one of seven senators who sent a letter Monday urging the Postal Service's Board of Governors to reverse DeJoy's changes to the agency. That letter noted that if DeJoy refuses to cooperate with their proposed reversal, the board has the authority to remove him.TVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT | ETListenTVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT | ETListenSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapPodcastsAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Photos emerged of the rifle allegedly used by Payton Gendron, 18, that appear to show the misspelled name of Virginia Sorenson, as well as that of a possible other parade victim, on its barrel, the Daily Beast said. Gendron added the n-word and, “Here’s your reparations” on the firearm, sources told The Post. Gendron is an alleged white supremacist who targeted a predominantly black neighborhood for Saturday’s massacre. Of the 13 people he blasted, 11 were black, officials said. Payton Gendron — the suspect who allegedly killed 10 people in a mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket — wrote the name of a victim of the Waukesha parade massacre on his gun.Erie County DA Virginia Sorenson’s name was reportedly written on the shooter’s gun.Facebook Sorenson, a 79-year-old white woman, was one of six people killed during a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wis., last year when a black man plowed his SUV into a crowd of celebrants. Suspected killer Darrell Edward Brooks endorsed attacking whites on social media before the horror. Authorities said that before Gendron’s slaughter, the teen wrote a 180-page manifesto focusing on the “great replacement” theory that argues immigrants are being purposefully brought into America to skew electoral results. Tap the right side of the screen below to watch this web story: Gendron, who shot 13 people at the Tops Friendly Supermarket in Buffalo on Saturday afternoon, has pleaded not guilty to murder charges and is expected to face additional raps as prosecutors ready their case against him.

Some ex-members who spoke to the Guardian said they were deeply concerned that too little was understood of People of Praise. Photograph: Demetrius Freeman/Getty ImagesPeople of Praise hire lawyers to investigate historical sexual abuse allegations as former members speak of ‘emotional torment’Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington@skirchyWed 21 Oct 2020 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 Oct 2020 23.37 EDTAmy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the supreme court has prompted former members of her secretive faith group, the People of Praise, to come forward and share stories about emotional trauma and – in at least one case – sexual abuse they claim to have suffered at the hands of members of the Christian group.'It instilled such problems': ex-member of Amy Coney Barrett's faith group speaks outRead moreIn the wake of the allegations, the Guardian has learned that the charismatic Christian organization, which is based in Indiana, has hired the law firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan to conduct an “independent investigation” into sexual abuse claims on behalf of People of Praise.The historic sexual abuse allegations and claims of emotional trauma do not pertain specifically to Barrett, who has been a lifelong member of the charismatic group, or her family.But some former members who spoke to the Guardian said they were deeply concerned that too little was understood about the “community” of People of Praise ahead of Barrett’s expected confirmation by the Senate next week, after which she will hold the seat formerly held by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Two people familiar with the matter say that more than two dozen former members of the faith group, many of whom say they felt “triggered” by Barrett’s nomination, are participating in a support group to discuss how the faith group affected their lives.“The basic premise of everything at the People of Praise was that the devil controlled everything outside of the community, and you were ‘walking out from under the umbrella of protection’ if you ever left,” said one former member who called herself Esther, who had to join the group as a child but then left the organization. “I was OK with it being in a tiny little corner of Indiana, because a lot of weird stuff happens in tiny little corners in this country. But it’s just unfathomable to me – I can’t even explain just how unfathomable it is – that you would have a supreme court justice who is a card-carrying member of this community.”Barrett was not asked about her involvement in People of Praise during her confirmation hearings last week, and has never included her involvement with the group in Senate disclosure forms, but has in the past emphasized that her religious faith as a devout Catholic would not interfere with her impartiality.05:10Amy Coney Barrett: key moments from the supreme court confirmation hearings – videoPeople of Praise is rooted in the rise of charismatic Christian communities in the late 1960s and 1970s, which blended Pentecostal traditions like speaking in tongues and prophecy with Catholicism. It is an ecumenical group – meaning it accepts members of different Christian churches – though its members are mostly Catholic. Proponents say charismatic Christians are bound together by members’ shared personal presence of Christ, and “empowerment through the Holy Spirit”.Its handbook emphasizes an insular view of the world, stressing obedience and devotion to other members, and communal living.Do you have information about this story? Email stephanie.kirchgaessner@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +1 646 886 8761.Barrett’s father has served as a leader in the community. Barrett was also listed as a “handmaid” in a 2010 directory, or female leader, served as a trustee at a school associated with the group, and has been featured in People of Praise magazines that were removed from the group’s website following her appointment as an appeals court judge in 2017.The Guardian has confirmed that Barrett lived in a household led by one of the founders of the People of Praise, Kevin Ranaghan, while she was a law student at Notre Dame, and lived with another People of Praise family – Barbette and William Brophy – in Virginia after she graduated.Proponents of the faith community have said in other press reports that they are misunderstood, and that it is a close-knit community that seeks to support other members “financially and materially and spiritually”.But former members paint a different picture. Allegations and concerns center on claims of the intense subjugation of women by the community leaders; control of members’ lives and decisions, including marriage, living arrangements, and child rearing; and in one case, the mishandling of allegations of sexual abuse. Members who admit to having gay sex are expelled from the group, which staunchly opposes same-sex marriage.For Sarah (Mitchell) Kuehl, a 48-year-old former member who grew up in the community, discussions about Barrett’s possible nomination prompted her – after years of trying to figure out how to address it – to send an email on 23 September to Craig Lent, the current head of People of Praise who also works as a professor at Notre Dame. In it, Kuehl claimed she had been sexually abused decades earlier by a “household member”, a male member of “the community” who had lived with the Mitchell family as part of the group’s communal living practices. Single people were expected to be celibate and live in family households which were expected to provide an example of married life, former members say.After her alleged abuser – who along with her family was technically a member of a precursor group called Servants of the Light/Lord that merged in 1984 with People of Praise – admitted to her father that he had been molesting Kuehl, he was moved to another household and eventually had a marriage “arranged” for him, she said. She was four years old when the abuse began and it lasted for two years. At the time, her family also lived with other single men and women.It’s unfathomable to me that you'd have a supreme court justice who is a card-carrying member of this communityEsther“I have struggled for years on whether to hold PoP accountable for what they knew, when they knew it and their attempt to hide and cover up. Like the Catholic church, who covered up and moved priests around, PoP has had a history of these same behaviors,” Kuehl alleged in her email to Lent.Letters provided to the Guardian by Kuehl dating back to the late 1980s and early 1990s substantiate claims of abuse and attempts by her parents to address the issue with senior leaders of People of Praise. The documents include references to a psychological evaluation of the alleged abuser and confirmation that he did abuse Kuehl. The documents also revealed there were additional victims and that other minors were at risk.Years later, when Kuehl sought to discuss the issue with her “handmaid” – a female guide and senior member of the organization, when she was at college – she said she was discouraged from talking about it.“She told me NOT to talk about it with anyone because it could ‘hurt the reputation of the community’,” Kuehl wrote in her letter to Lent.Weeks later, on 5 October, Lent responded to Kuehl’s email. He wrote: “I am just reaching out to you to let you know that we take this matter very seriously.”He added: “We very much want to look into this. To that end we have contracted with Diane Doolittle of Quinn Emanuel, who specializes in exactly this sort of investigation. (This took some time to arrange.) I want to stress that, although she is a lawyer, her role is not to defend PoP, but rather she is very much in the role of an independent investigator. We thought that better than trying to investigate it directly ourselves. We want to know the truth of the matter. She will be talking to other people as well.”Doolittle’s online bio states that she is a Silicon Valley-based trial lawyer who is involved in “high-stakes complex commercial, intellectual property and white collar cases”. She is also listed as having been engaged in “sensitive #MeToo cases, including by conducting corporate internal investigations”.But People of Praise’s choice is also noteworthy because of Quinn Emanuel’s ties to the White House. William Burck, who serves as Quinn Emanuel’s co-managing partner in Washington DC, has counted Steve Bannon as a client, among others, and was a friend and associate of supreme court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. During Kavanaugh’s controversial confirmation hearings, it was Burck – a “Washington super-lawyer” – who was charged with culling Kavanaugh’s documents for review before the Senate hearing.There is no evidence that Burck has been personally engaged in the People of Praise investigation.In a statement, People of Praise spokesman Sean Connolly said: “We believe that one of our highest callings is the bond of trust around our community’s safety, and we take allegations of abuse or misconduct very seriously. In this matter, we understand the survivor’s abuse occurred in the mid-1970s when the survivor’s family and the perpetrator were members of a different religious community called the Servants of the Light/Lord in the Minneapolis area. People of Praise did not exist in Minnesota until October 1983.”He added: “We understand that this is a deeply painful matter for the survivor and her family and we extend to them our prayers”Connolly also said People of Praise had adopted a child safety policy that included mandatory law enforcement reporting obligations in instances of alleged child abuse. He did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about its decision to hire Quinn Emanuel or whether the group was aware of its representation of Trump administration officials.Kuehl told the Guardian she was eager not to be seen as seeking revenge on People of Praise, or questioning Barrett’s character, intelligence, or her legal mind. As a devout Catholic who regularly attends mass and is a mother of five, she is also not anti-religious, but rather feels a “deep concern regarding the culture of secrecy, abuse of power and male-dominant hierarchy” at People of Praise.Top Senate Republican says he has the votes to confirm Amy Coney BarrettRead moreEsther, who approached the Guardian but did not want to be identified, described how her parents had become members of People of Praise after a family tragedy upended their lives. The next eight years of her life, she said, were filled with “emotional torment” as she watched her parents “obediently embrace one conspiracy after another”.“Anyone who was not charismatic was not to be trusted and most likely an operator for ‘the evil one’. The devil was always trying to trick us and the only way to stay safe was to follow obediently the rules set up by ‘the co-ordinators’,” she said. “I was not allowed to watch TV for two years until that was no longer a directive; my mother could only cook with natural foods until that was no longer a fad … I was prohibited from owning a record/tape unless it was Christian rock.”She added: “We were devout Catholics too but there were strong insinuations that the diocese had strayed and could not be trusted.”People of Praise did not comment on allegations of emotional abuse and trauma experienced by other former members.TopicsAmy Coney BarrettUS supreme courtLaw (US)US politicsChristianityReligionnewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight to voteNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now he feels terrible about what he’s done to the country. AP Photo/Patrick Semansky By Michael Grunwald 08/19/2020 04:30 AM EDT Link Copied Michael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine. Stuart Stevens spent four decades helping Republicans—a lot of Republicans—win. He’s one of the most successful political operatives of his generation, crafting ads and devising strategies for President George W. Bush, Republican presidential nominees Mitt Romney and Bob Dole, and dozens of GOP governors, senators and congressmen. He didn’t win every race, but he thinks he had the best won-lost record in Republican campaign world. And now he feels terrible about it. Stevens now believes the Republican Party is, not to put too fine a point on it, a malign force jeopardizing the survival of American democracy. He’s written a searing apologia of a book called It Was All a Lie that compares his lifelong party to the Mafia, to Bernie Madoff’s fraud scheme, to the segregationist movement, even to the Nazis. He’s pretty disillusioned. While Stevens is one of the most prominent “Never Trump” Republicans, and It Was All a Lie is predictably scathing about the failures of President Donald Trump, the book does not blame Trump for the failures of the party he leads. It essentially takes for granted that Trump is as bad a president and a human being as his worst Democratic critics say—and that he constantly violates supposedly bedrock Republican commitments to free trade, family values, limited government and the Constitution. His point is that Trump is a fitting representative of the modern GOP. It Was All a Lie is really about the party that spawned Trump and now marches in near-lockstep behind him—the party to which 67-year-old Stevens has devoted his career. The GOP’s abject surrender to its unorthodox and unconservative leader was a surprise to Stevens, but he has concluded that he shouldn’t have been surprised. Stevens, a child of segregated Mississippi who has written powerfully about race in the past, says he always knew there was hostility toward minorities and immigrants and science within his party. But he thought that strain was a recessive gene, when it turned out to be the dominant gene. He was an unapologetic political hack whose job was helping Republicans win, but he always thought he was fighting for conservative policies and ideas, for a party that cared about something more than winning. Aboard Mitt Romney's campaign plane in Sept. 2012, senior adviser Stuart Stevens speaks to the press. | AP Photo/Evan Vucci He doesn’t think that anymore, and his conversion story is getting a lot of buzz. It debuted at No. 8 on the New York Times best-seller list, helped in part by an attention-grabbing op-ed in the New York Times, and he’s been featured on National Public Radio, the New Yorker, the Ezra Klein podcast, and other outlets that Republicans consider the heart of the liberal media establishment. The book makes it abundantly clear that Stevens feels shame about his role in perpetuating Republican lies, but it’s not entirely clear whether he thinks he was lying, lied to, or just lying to himself. There are times when It Was All a Lie sounds less like an apology than an “if-only” book about how some good Republicans could have saved the country from Trumpism. Stevens writes glowingly about his clients who have never embraced Trump—like President George W. Bush, who he believes could have steered the party towards “compassionate conservatism” if the September 11 attacks hadn’t changed history, or Utah Senator Mitt Romney, who has emerged as a lonely voice of Republican resistance, or popular moderate governors like Larry Hogan of Maryland, Phil Scott of Vermont and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts. His book is notably silent about his clients who have bent their knees to Trump—like Senators John Cornyn of Texas, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rob Portman of Ohio, Charles Grassley of Iowa, or Dan Coats of Indiana, who became Trump’s top intelligence official. Politico Magazine senior writer Michael Grunwald first met Stevens 25 years ago when he was working for William Weld, a moderate Republican governor who was running a futile campaign to unseat Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, and who would later run a futile primary campaign to unseat Trump. Grunwald talked with Stevens last week about the evolution of the Republican Party, its “conspiracy of cowardice” under Trump, its prioritization of politics over policy, his secret effort to undermine Trump in the 2016 election, his disdain for Republican thought leaders like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, and his fears for the 2020 election, which he expects Trump to try to steal. They also talked about some of the tensions within It Was All a Lie, and Stevens opened up about his disappointment with former clients he genuinely admired. This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. *** MICHAEL GRUNWALD: You’ve written a really provocative book. STUART STEVENS: I told a friend: It’s depressing, but it’s short. He said: Yeah, so are suicide notes. GRUNWALD: It must feel weird. You’ve had this incredibly successful career electing Republicans, you write a book saying it was all a lie—and suddenly you’re a brave truth-telling hero. STEVENS: Yeah? I must have missed the hero part. GRUNWALD: Well, you write the big mea culpa, and suddenly all these people who fought you love you. STEVENS: I don’t look at it that way, dude. You know how painful it is to admit some of these people were right? GRUNWALD: You’re brutal when you talk about the Republican Party right now. You compare it to Bernie Madoff, to the Mafia, you even have a bunch of Nazi Germany comparisons. What’s been the reaction of the people you used to work with? STEVENS: I really don’t talk to most of those people. Look, I wanted to be careful not to make the book a bill of indictment against individuals, because that’s a cop-out. If I’m saying it’s a collective problem, and I want to start with personal responsibility. It’s countermessaging to say this person did this, that person did that. Look, these people know who they are. They all know Donald Trump shouldn’t be president. They all know something wrong has happened in the party. For the most part, they’re just quiet about it. You won’t hear them defend Trump except as a necessary evil. “Mitch McConnell thinks Trump will be remembered as his fool, and I think the odds are pretty good it’s going to be the other way around.” You know, it really struck me when I read the memoir by [the late German Chancellor] Franz von Papen, it’s exactly the same message you hear today. In 1953, he was still trying to justify Hitler: “You have to understand, the Bolsheviks were a threat, we had to counter them.” Of all the books I read to write my book, the Franz von Papen thing haunts me the most. It’s not to say that what happened in Germany is going to happen here. But the idea that you can’t talk about that—well, I think you have to talk about that. The parallel is so striking. GRUNWALD: That’s pretty harsh. What’s the specific parallel you’re talking about? STEVENS: You have good people letting evil happen. For the most part, these Republicans aren’t bad people. If you moved in next door, they’d be a great neighbor. But that was true of a lot of segregationists I knew growing up in Mississippi. They wouldn’t have used a racial slur for a million dollars, but they wouldn’t stand up—“Oh, we need to be slow about change.” And what is Germany but a story of people who faced a moral moment and failed? You had a powerful political aristocracy that thought they could control this necessary evil for their own purposes. They thought they could harness it. Like the atom, or something, and they ended up with Chernobyl. All these Republicans who know Donald Trump is a disaster will try to justify it, because they got something they wanted. Mitch McConnell thinks Trump will be remembered as his fool, and I think the odds are pretty good it’s going to be the other way around. Republicans always say that you can’t negotiate with terrorists; well, Donald Trump is a terrorist, and the Republican Party decided to negotiate with him. How has that worked out? He’s destroyed conservatism. He’s the most anti-conservative president of my lifetime. GRUNWALD: You talk about personal responsibility in the book, but I never got a clear sense of what you think your personal responsibility was for all this. What did you do wrong? STEVENS: You know, I ask myself that all the time. I worked for people I liked and admired, people I wanted to win. I didn’t work for the Jesse Helmses of the world. Really, there are two Republican parties, even now. There are some great governors; we don’t talk about that much, but I worked for a lot of them: Tom Ridge [of Pennsylvania], Bill Weld. I do regret not thinking more about the reality of this dark side of the party. When I worked for Mitt Romney, I thought, and I still think this is right, that we were fighting the Newt Gingrich side of the party, which is now the Trump side of the party. And we won. So it’s hard for me to say I wish I had done this differently or that differently. POLITICO Dispatch: August 19 It might be Joe Biden's convention, but Michelle and Barack are the stars. We break down why Michelle's speech wowed viewers on Monday — and what to expect from Biden's former boss tonight. Subscribe on Apple Podcasts | Subscribe on Google Podcasts But I helped elect a lot of Republicans. My firm, which I left a year and a half ago, was more successful at electing Republicans than anyone else. And this is how the party has ended up. So how could I not have some responsibility? I can’t square that circle. There’s a genre of book that’s very popular in Washington: “If Only They Had Listened to Me.” I didn’t want to write that book, because they did listen to me! GRUNWALD: You write about how you worked for Ridge, for Weld, for Charlie Baker, for Larry Hogan, for Phil Scott. But those are the guys who don’t support Trump. And Romney, who’s now the voice of the resistance. But you had clients who were maybe more relevant to your thesis who you didn’t write about at all. STEVENS: Here’s one way to look at this: You could say that by 1999, when George W. Bush runs for president, conservatism had been a victim of its own success. We won the Cold War. Welfare reform passed under Bill Clinton! Taxes were no longer at 70 percent. Crime was going way down. I think Governor Bush looked at all that and said: What does it mean to be a conservative? Out of that came the framework of compassionate conservatism. What was his first big piece of legislation? No Child Left Behind. That picture of him at the signing with Ted Kennedy—today that would be evidence for a war crimes tribunal. But you can make a good case that vision of the party died on 9/11, when Bush became a wartime president. There’s a parlor game among those of us who worked for Bush and loved Bush about what kind of president he would’ve been like without 9/11. I think you could make the case that he would’ve transformed the party. Likewise, if Mitt Romney had won in 2012, I think he would’ve taken the party in a very different direction. So one conclusion I’ve reached is that leaders really matter. In the 1930s, why didn’t we become fascist? Probably because Roosevelt was president and not Lindbergh. Why was the civil rights movement defined by nonviolence? Probably because of Martin Luther King. If Stokely Carmichael had a similar role, it would’ve been different. But part of a role of a political party should be to form a circuit-breaker function. To me, with Trump, it all goes back to the Muslim ban in December 2015. The party should’ve rejected that. If the Republican Party stands for anything, it’s supposed to be the Constitution. “Why does the Republican Party exist today? It exists to beat Democrats. That’s not a political party. That’s a cartel.” I understand why it didn’t happen. Trump has always benefited from the inability to imagine Trump. So the other 15 candidates running all killed each other to try to get one-on-one with Trump, because obviously Republicans weren’t going to nominate a failed casino owner, a maxed-out donor to Anthony Weiner, who talked about having sex with his daughter. Are you crazy? But they did. I went around trying to get prominent Republicans in key states to run against Trump as a favorite son. The idea was if you just take a few points away from Trump in Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, he couldn’t win. I can say I had 100 percent failure. Everyone I talked to, it was all confidential, but they all said that if we, the establishment, put our thumb on the scales, when he loses it won’t be because he was racist and had terrible ideas, it will be because of us. We’ll get blamed. It’s better if we just lose, face what we did, and rebuild. I was like: Yeah, I agree, but what if he wins? And I didn’t think he was going to win, either, so I probably wasn’t very good at arguing. But he did win, and the party just fell right in line. I keep coming back to: What does the party stand for? Four years ago, 90 percent of Republicans would say personal responsibility, character counts, strong on Russia, fiscal sanity, legal immigration, free trade. But now the party’s 100 percent against all these things. We’re left of Bernie Sanders on trade. We’re way to his left on Russia; Bernie may have honeymooned in Russia, but he didn’t marry Putin. We’re for an imperial presidency. I guess when the next Democratic president does an executive order for a wealth tax, we’ll be OK with it. GRUNWALD: But Republicans won’t be OK with it. They’re not OK with an imperial presidency in general; they’re OK with a Republican imperial presidency. STEVENS: That’s right. Why does the Republican Party exist today? It exists to beat Democrats. That’s not a political party. That’s a cartel. Why do bowling clubs exist? Because you like to go bowling. Fine. Just don’t kid yourself that you’re joining anything to do with principle or purpose. And I don’t think you can undo this stuff. What happened to the party in 1964 with African Americans? You went from 40 percent with Eisenhower to 7 percent with Goldwater and they never came back. Is this going to happen with Hispanics? Goldwater wasn’t out attacking black people; he just wasn’t for the civil rights bill. I wouldn’t call him a bigot. Trump is out there attacking Hispanics. Why did Republicans used to get 70 percent of Asian Americans, now we lose 70 percent? It wasn’t even like we were out attacking Asian-Americans, at least until recently, when Trump had a list of people he hadn’t attacked and he finally got to the Chinese. But they got the message that if you weren’t white, you weren’t welcome in the party. How does the party allow that to happen? How does the party that’s supposed to be for family values stand by while the president, the head of the Republican Party, wishes a woman well who’s just been arrested for being at the center of an international child rape ring? It’s like a “Saturday Night Live” skit: What would it take for Republicans to support a moderate Democrat. What if the Republican candidate was a child molester? Nope! Not a problem! We’ll vote for Roy Moore. GRUNWALD: But you’re talking about Republican voters, right? There’s that old politician saying: “The voters have spoken, the bastards.” You’re saying this is about leadership, but maybe this is just what Republican voters want. Your guy Mitt Romney attacked Rick Perry for being soft on immigration in the 2012 primary; presumably he figured the party was where it was. STEVENS: Oh, I don’t know about that. In one of those primary debates, they asked who considered Barack Obama a socialist, and Romney was the only one who didn’t raise his hand. When Romney said “self-deport,” he was arguing against forced deportation. He was actually taking the left position, saying we ought to make it more desirable for people to stay in their own country and less desirable for illegal immigrants to be here. Basically, the Barack Obama position, he just came up with this weird phrasing. GRUNWALD: Come on, though. Obviously, Trump has gone in some extreme directions, but Republican candidates have been running ton some of this stuff for a while. Take climate change. Neither Bush nor Romney was acknowledging the science. STEVENS: Well, Romney was closer, but I agree. Climate is a good example of what’s gone wrong. But I’d like to think if Bush or Romney were president today, they wouldn’t be saying what Trump is saying about climate. Issues can change really rapidly. Look at the shift on gay marriage. GRUNWALD: I’m not surprised that you’d like to think that. You wrote very positively about Bush and Romney in your book. But given what you’ve seen from the party, why do you have any confidence that this isn’t just what the party demands? STEVENS: My confidence is that there’s a malleability within the party. The voters could’ve been led in a different direction. If Pat Buchanan had won the nomination against Bush, it would’ve been a very different party than it was. Look at George Wallace in his Democratic primary. He got a tremendously positive response. He just didn’t win. But if he had won, and the Democratic establishment had supported him, the party would’ve been totally different. It just didn’t happen—and I don’t think it could’ve happened. The Democratic establishment wouldn’t have supported George Wallace. But the Republican establishment supported Donald Trump. “Right now, are there Republicans out there willing to lose an election to fight for what Republicans say we believe in?” Look, part of this is just race. Since 1964, the party has predominantly been a white party. What happens to any business that discovers that 75 or 80 percent of its support comes from a certain market segment? You get good at talking to those people and bad at talking to other people. The difference, to me, and maybe some would argue this is a distinction without a difference, is what we aspired to, and what we admit are failures. I think it’s really important for the party to admit it has failed to attract African Americans—as opposed to now, when Trump is supposed to be the greatest president for blacks ever. It’s a big difference. I mean, what would Donald Trump have done to Muslims after 9/11? He would’ve rounded them up. What did George Bush do? He defended them. It doesn’t mean the Iraq war wasn’t a disaster, but it means something. GRUNWALD: You talked in your book about the Republican “autopsy” after the 2012 election, when the party said it needed to do better with people of color. But your conclusion was that they mostly meant they needed to fake it better to win their votes, not actually change. STEVENS: Yeah, that’s true. But Bush really meant it about Muslims. It would’ve been more politically expedient to attack Muslims. Right now, are there Republicans out there willing to lose an election to fight for what Republicans say we believe in? Not very many. What conclusion do you come to other than that you never believed this stuff? GRUNWALD: OK, let’s say Bush defending Muslims is a good example of decency and leadership and principles. But you mentioned that a core Republican principle was fiscal sanity. Even during your career, long before Trump, when has the Republican Party stood for fiscal sanity? It’s blown up the deficit every time it’s taken power. STEVENS: You’re right! In 1994, after Bill Clinton raised taxes, I and every other Republican consultant made a million ads about how this would lead to the Dust Bowl. Instead, it led to the greatest period of economic expansion in American history. He was the last president to wrestle the deficit to a standstill. GRUNWALD: Obama cut the deficit, too. STEVENS: It’s true. The deficit has gone down much more under Democrats than Republicans. That’s a fact. You can’t argue with that. It’s a perfect example of how Republicans never believed what they were saying. If you asked them to take a lie detector test, do you believe in lower deficits, they’d say yes and pass. But they were never willing to do anything to back it up. GRUNWALD: Paul Ryan is the ultimate example of that. He’s been for every tax cut, more defense spending, he’s never taken a vote to reduce the deficit—and he was Romney’s running mate. STEVENS: Most public policy disasters have some fundamental flawed conceit at their root. And this Republican idea that you can magically cut taxes and grow your way out of the deficit, it’s no different than trying to argue that gravity is a regional phenomenon. GRUNWALD: But that’s been Republican dogma. We spent some time together in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate campaign, when you were working for Weld. He was a really successful governor, very moderate, pro-environment, a goofy happy-go-lucky guy, but he ran a very dark campaign about crime, welfare and taxes. And you did those classic Republican ads with the grainy footage of the city at night with the scary music. In Massachusetts! Let me ask you as a political consultant: Can a Republican win without appealing to fear? STEVENS: It’s not how Reagan won. He appealed to optimism. To be born an American in Reagan’s era was to be the luckiest person in the world. In Trump’s era, you’re a victim, you’re a chump, there are these powerful forces taking advantage of you. Like Canada. It’s a complete reversal. GRUNWALD: But you ran a fear campaign in Massachusetts in 1996 with a really popular candidate. You’re not stupid. Why? STEVENS: Well, Weld didn’t run on abortion or social issues. Kerry really was to the left of Bill Clinton on crime, welfare and taxes. Look, you can make a good case that Hillary Clinton in 2016 ran against Bill Clinton in 1992. Putting 100,000 cops on the street became mass incarceration. Ending welfare as we know it became cruel inequality. Basically, what Weld ran in 1996 was what would be a moderate Democrat today. You look at a lot of Democrats getting elected in the Northeast today, like Conor Lamb, they would have been Republicans back then. And there aren’t any Republican senators like Bill Weld would’ve been. They don’t exist. The people who normally would be like that, someone like [Missouri Senator] Josh Hawley, very smart guy, went to Stanford, Yale Law, taught at St. George’s in London, wrote a very good biography of Teddy Roosevelt. Perfect example of a guy who could’ve been a positive influence in the party, like [former Missouri Senator] John Danforth. Instead, he’s running against the elites. Really, Josh? Really? I mean, Weld wasn’t anti-intellectual. He didn’t claim that higher education leads to socialism. That’s now a bedrock principle in the Republican Party. The party has basically joined the Red Guard and the Khmer Rouge, attacking higher education. And it’s never the peasants leading the charge. It’s the educated. These are the most phony people in the world. Ted Cruz. Here’s a guy that’s punched every establishment button there is to punch, and he’s attacking elites. Really! Your wife is at Goldman Sachs. You were born in Vancouver, dude. GRUNWALD: Well, now that you’re finally naming some names, let me name a few Republicans who aren’t standing up to Trump. Chuck Grassley. Roy Blunt. Rob Portman. John Cornyn. STEVENS: I worked for all those guys. GRUNWALD: I know. You presumably didn’t work for them because you thought they were hypocrites. What happened? STEVENS: I’m not going to get into criticizing each of these. But let me just say: I never would have believed what’s happening now would happen. I never would’ve believed that John Cornyn, serious Texas Supreme Court jurist, reluctant politician, would be tweeting complaints about how nine out of 10 new Texans are Hispanic. I don’t understand it. I don’t understand how we could have the worst economy in the history of America, more Americans have died from a disease in the last four months than have ever died of anything in America, and John Cornyn is in a hearing asking questions about Hillary Clinton’s emails. I don’t get it. “I think there’s a sort of conspiracy of cowardice—when everyone’s a coward, you don’t feel like a coward.” GRUNWALD: You spent time with these guys. STEVENS: Listen, dude. So much time. I really don’t understand it, but I’ll never wonder again how 1938 happened in Germany. The cowardice is contagious. I think there’s a sort of conspiracy of cowardice—when everyone’s a coward, you don’t feel like a coward. That’s why these Republicans resent Mitt Romney. He reminds them that they don’t have to be cowards, and it makes them feel bad. GRUNWALD: I always remember that after Weld lost to Kerry, you told me that he was just doomed because Bob Dole got only like 30 percent of the vote for president in Massachusetts. Your line was that it’s just gravity. I always think about that when Republicans march in lockstep behind Trump, because it’s tough for them when he’s at 40 percent, but if they start slagging him and he slips to 30 percent, they’ll all lose their jobs. It’s just gravity, right? STEVENS: Yes, but what I don’t understand, and I say this as a statement of my own inadequacy: Most politicians have pretty big egos. That doesn’t bother me. But why don’t they understand how they’re going to be remembered? I’m not talking about 40 years from now when everyone’s dead. I’m talking about two years from now. Why can’t they grasp that this is a moral test? This is Kitty Genovese getting raped and nobody saying anything. That’s what Donald Trump is. So what if you lose a primary? Would you have rather been the guy who ran against George Wallace or the guy who endorsed him? GRUNWALD: If Trump loses, are Republicans going to be like: Donald who? Never knew the guy… STEVENS: I don’t think so. History says that when a major political party endorses hate, and that’s what Trumpism is, that’s very hard to undo. It takes a lot of time and sometimes a lot of blood to undo; I hope it doesn’t take a lot of blood. It’s odd, because the successful and wildly popular Republicans right now are the governors—Baker, Hogan, Scott. If Republicans could win their states in a presidential race, it’s over. Shouldn’t the party say: What can we learn from them? They’re selling our product in the hardest markets, and they’re selling the hell out of it. But they’re treated with benign neglect. That just says it all about where the party is. You don’t undo this stuff. Look at Nikki Haley, a once-serious person, trying to negotiate with this, like she’s going to be the good segregationist. You can’t do it. You just can’t do it. GRUNWALD: Let me ask another mean question. The biggest theme in your book is that all Republicans care about is winning, it’s all just politics. That was your job, helping Republicans win; you spent the rest of the year skiing and having fun. But governing is about policy, and you’re saying that the policy stuff all turned out to be bogus. Can you talk about that dichotomy? STEVENS: Haley Barbour likes to say: More than you think, good policy is good politics. There’s a lot of truth to that. Those governors are popular because their policies are good. It’s not like Charlie Baker has a rock-star cult of personality. GRUNWALD: But he’s in the weeds. He cares about government. I remember when he was the wonk bureaucrat who ran Weld’s government, I was the dork reporter who bugged him all the time. Then I came to Washington in the late Clinton era, and when George W. Bush and the Republicans replaced him, it felt like the hacks were replacing the wonks. Obviously it’s more extreme now in the Trump era, but there weren’t a lot of Charlie Bakers in Republican D.C. STEVENS: I think you’re absolutely right. Who are the intellectual leaders of the Republican Party? People like Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity. Laura and Tucker are smart people who are saying stupid things because it’s good for their careers, and because they have some sort of strange emotional issues they’re working through publicly. They’re both angry people. Hannity is just a guy who never graduated from college having the time of his life. But they’re the intellectual leaders of the party. That’s one of the reasons I felt it was so important to track William Buckley in the book. Now, there’s this lost sense of intellectual seriousness that Buckley personified. And that’s true. But Buckley also started as a stone-cold segregationist. GRUNWALD: Sure, but it wasn’t like you didn’t know about Buckley’s history. I guess you just thought it wasn’t the important part of Republican history. STEVENS: I thought the evolution Buckley went through was almost a biological evolution that any intelligent person would go through. I thought you would have to come to grips with the reality that racism was a flawed conceit. I thought that was inevitable. I wouldn’t have thought it possible that a president in 2020 would be defending Confederate monuments and the Confederate flag, or that his chief of staff John Kelly would be arguing that slavery wasn’t the cause of Civil War. I would’ve thought it was no more likely than that we’d be having a debate about gravity. I was wrong. “I think Trump and the Republican Party have officially validated hate as an acceptable response to politics.” GRUNWALD: I’m a climate obsessive, so from my perspective I’ve been covering a debate about gravity for 15 years, and almost every Republican has been on the wrong side of it. So why wouldn’t they be on the wrong side of other gravity-type debates? STEVENS: My response to that is: I was wrong and you were right. And now, the same tendencies that led to denying climate change has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans from a virus. There’s no other way to look at it. GRUNWALD: Obama said after his election that maybe now the fever will break, which was obviously wrong. You don’t think that if the Democrats win big, the fever will break? STEVENS: No. I think Trump and the Republican Party have officially validated hate as an acceptable response to politics. Just as if we elected a bank robber president, bank robbery will become more socially acceptable, the same thing has happened here. That won’t change. What’s going to change is they’re going to lose. We don’t know how long it will take before they lose. Maybe they’ll hang on longer than we expect. But the majority of Americans under 15 are nonwhite. The odds are damn good that when they turn 18 they’ll still be nonwhite. That’s a death sentence for the Republican Party. We know what’s going to happen: Look at California. It was the beating heart of the Republican Party, and now not much happens there that the Republican Party is involved in. GRUNWALD: If this white grievance party sees power slipping away, what happens? You said earlier you hope it won’t be bloody. STEVENS: I think we’re in the most dangerous period for American democracy since the Civil War. I ask this question in all seriousness: What could you tell Donald Trump that X bad thing will happen to America but you’ll win, where he would say no? I can’t think of anything. If you told Trump that Putin will control America, but you’ll get to stay president, he’d say what’s the catch? And you can’t come up with a handful of Republicans who would stand up to him. GRUNWALD: So Roy Blunt, who you helped send to Washington, he’ll be cool with that. STEVENS: I would say I hope not. GRUNWALD: He hasn’t stood up on anything else. STEVENS: I love the guy. I admire the guy. I have tremendous respect for him, as opposed to a total phony like Josh Hawley. GRUNWALD: But it’s hard to see him on the ramparts. STEVENS: I’m not going to talk about that. GRUNWALD: Dan Coats was your client, too. Then he went to run intelligence for Trump. STEVENS: I could not have more respect for Dan Coats. Look, Mike Pence is a protégé of his, and he thought it would be better for the country if he were in that position. I guess it’s like being in France or Norway in 1943; you’ve got to make a decision about what to do. I just know I would have been a guy out there blowing up bridges. I wouldn’t have been like, let’s make this work better. GRUNWALD: The Nazi analogy again. STEVENS: Look, in July, Trump was already talking about suspending the elections. What do you think he’s going to do in October? Tell me what’s wrong with this scenario: It’s November 1, he’s losing, there are reports of voter irregularities in Florida, like there always are, and he sends those guys in camouflage into Miami-Dade County to seize the ballot boxes. Who’s going to stop him? The county security guards? They’re not going to phone ahead. What are the courts going to do? Order another election? Throw out Dade County? I don’t know. Who would object? [Attorney General William] Barr would go right along with it. The inability to imagine Trump has always been his greatest advantage. Normal people expect people who are acting abnormally to revert to normality. Trump understands that and he’s not a normal person. With the United States government, you’ve given Tony Soprano the paving contract and you’re acting shocked that he doesn’t seem interested in getting the road paved. GRUNWALD: Maybe it’s unrealistic to expect normal Republican politicians to act any differently than they’ve been acting. Maybe courage would be the abnormal approach. STEVENS: Can you tell me these people care about America? About patriotism? I know they don’t. If these Republicans were in charge in 1775, do you think there would’ve been a revolution? Not in a million years! They would say: What, we’re going to fight the king? Are you crazy? The people afraid of a Donald Trump tweet would’ve been afraid of the king. It’s pretty obvious. But I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything like what we’re seeing right now. It’s always hard when you’re in the middle of something to realize it’s extraordinary.

President joe Biden always considered the plausibility of a Russian invasion and dreaded its consequences. Not just for the human costs, but how it might harm his presidency. He could foresee how a distant conflict might reverberate at home—with skyrocketing energy prices that could slow the economic recovery and retaliatory ransomware attacks that could disrupt daily life. To stave off the worst case, he kept offering Vladimir Putin opportunities to back away, even if he didn’t put much stock in them.Over the course of his initial conversations with Putin, he chastised the Russian leader for interfering in the 2016 presidential election, damned him for the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, threatened him over ransomware attacks—and then set out to charm the man, sensing he had no other choice. Where Barack Obama once dismissed Russia as a “regional power,” Biden pointedly called it a “great power.” Rather than speaking with Putin on the sideline of a global conference, he met with him in Geneva, one-on-one, a gesture of respect meant to recall the Cold War summits of yore. I imagine Biden choking on his words—or perhaps suppressing the urge to take a swing—as he tried to initiate a productive conversation with the man whose intelligence services did whatever it could to elect Donald Trump.Biden was hoping to avert the crisis that arrived last night as Russian rockets began to fall on Ukrainian cities. As Putin made his middle-of-the-night public case for invasion, he warned Biden against escalating by threatening the very worst—“consequences greater than any you have faced in history.” Even if that’s bluster, it sets Biden’s dilemma in relief: How far is he willing to go in preventing Putin from realizing his irredentist dreams?In March 2021, the White House published its “Interim National Security Strategic Guidance,” a first pass at laying out Biden’s foreign policy. The document argued that the United States was locked in a global struggle to preserve democracy against its authoritarian enemies. And it was clear which authoritarian state was top of mind: “This agenda will strengthen our enduring advantages and allow us to prevail in strategic competition with China or any other nation.” Russia fell into the bucket of “any other nation.”Read our ongoing coverage of the Russian invasion in UkraineAlthough Biden always regarded Russia as a threat, he didn’t regard it as a long-term priority. Unlike China, Russia isn’t an economic competitor. With a few exceptions, such as Venezuela and Nicaragua, Russia hasn’t built a network of alliances or effectively projected soft power. There are no prominent magazine articles or academic books extolling the advantages of the Russian Model. Biden tried to make Putin feel respected, but he did so with the intent of buying space for American foreign policy to reorient to the Indo-Pacific.But from the start, Biden worried about how tensions with Russia could spin out of control. The White House has always regarded Putin as an adversary who can’t be deterred by conventional means. They believe he has the mindset of a guerrilla fighter—who has no conscience about widening the battlefield to civilian targets—which limits the ability of the United States to respond in kind. To become enmeshed in a conflict with Russia is to inevitably become the victim of cyberattacks against banking systems and digital infrastructure, assaults with the intent of paralyzing society.After the fall of the Soviet Union, citizens around the world deposed police states and embraced political liberalism. It wasn’t a painless transition—and there’s been gnarly backsliding in places such as Hungary and Poland. Still, most of the inhabitants of a former empire assumed political agency.Putin at first tried his hand at illiberal democracy—to live within the democratic contours that emerged after the collapse of communism. In Ukraine, for a time, he managed to use bribery, the ruthless exploitation of tribal anxieties, and disinformation to shape the country’s course to his liking. But in 2014, the country decisively rejected Russian-led kleptocracy. And after Putin failed to exert control over Ukraine through peaceable means, he reverted to the barrel of a gun.His invasion of Ukraine—which began in 2014—reflects the autocratic view of the global order. For the strongman, a government’s only meaningful source of legitimacy is strength. Borders are simply an expression of a nation’s might. A people’s sense of nationhood and its claims to its own history are meaningless if it is too weak to defend itself. In the state of nature, all that matters is the triumph of will. Another country’s democratic choices—its self-determination, to use an antique term—are unworthy of respect. And because Putin did not meaningfully suffer for 2014, he can logically claim vindication: Democracy simply doesn’t have the fortitude to withstand his strength.Alexander Vindman: America could have done so much more to protect UkraineIn Biden’s mind, a conflict with Russia takes the form of a clash of dueling systems—an ideological clash described in his “Interim National Security Strategic Guidance.” Although he wanted to contain Russia, he also sought to refute Putin’s notion that the West has become too decadent to mount a credible defense of itself. Or as Biden wrote in the introduction to his strategy, the underlying purpose of American foreign policy is to prove that democracy is “not a relic of history.”If those sentiments are to have any meaning, he has no choice but to come to Ukraine’s, and democracy’s, defense—to disprove the strongman’s assertion about democracy’s weakness. While he’s explicitly ruled out sending troops to Ukraine, he’s also planning on arming an insurgency. What form will this take? Will the U.S. send military advisers? What risks will the U.S. take to deliver arms to Ukrainian fighters? If Putin is bent on provoking NATO into a wider war, will Biden join it? These are dreadful questions, where high ideals crash against terrifying realities, and they will define the Biden presidency.

By Alex Ward@AlexWardVox Updated Feb 27, 2019, 7:26am EST Share this story Share this on Facebook Share this on Twitter Share All sharing options Share All sharing options for: “A bad deal for the United States”: top South Korean official rejects tentative Trump-Kim pact Reddit Pocket Flipboard Email Moon Chung-in, a special national security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, speaks to the media in Seoul on September 13, 2018. Lee Jin-man/AP A proposed outline of a deal that President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may sign during their Vietnam summit this week would be “a bad deal for the United States.” That’s not the view of a cynical expert, or a Democrat. It’s the view of a top national security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump and Kim are in Hanoi to discuss how to strike a deal to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear program. Negotiators are currently working with an outline of a deal first described to Vox by three knowledgeable sources on Tuesday, where the US would lift some sanctions on North Korea in exchange for a commitment from Kim to stop nuclear-fuel production at a key nuclear facility. Both leaders would also sign a peace declaration to end hostilities toward each other and open liaison offices in both countries, and North Korea would return the remains of a yet-unspecified number of missing US troops who fought and died in the Korean War. But when asked publicly about the Vox-reported outline of the pact by the event’s moderator, Moon Chung-in, a special adviser for foreign affairs and national security to South Korea’s president, was not impressed. “It’s a good deal for North Korea and a bad deal for the United States,” he said during a Tuesday speaking engagement at the Korea Economic Institute in Washington. He went on to say what he’d prefer to see out of Hanoi is a roadmap for negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang going forward and Yongbyon — the key North Korean nuclear facility — completely shutdown. When I followed up with him after the session, Moon reiterated his point about the tentative outline. “It’s not a very good deal,” he told me. For all the incentives the US might give North Korea, “the US can get much more than that,” he said. I emailed Moon Tuesday night and asked him to clarify once more. Here’s part of what he wrote back on Wednesday morning. “Our government cannot accept the idea of exchanging a simple freeze of nuclear activities for such hefty incentives as peace declaration, liaison office, and relaxation of sanction,” he said. “I was only criticizing the hypothetical outline, especially idea of freeze,” he added, noting that if the moderator had said the deal included closing Yongbyon down, which as of now is not in the tentative deal outline, “my answer should have been different.” Why Moon Chung-in’s statement matters There’s still a long way to go before Trump and Kim put pen to paper, and of course the deal could change dramatically between now and then. But Moon’s statements are still shocking — and here’s why. Moon Chung-in’s boss, Moon Jae-in (no relation), has been a fervent champion of the US and North Korea’s attempts to end the years-long nuclear standoff, and he’s consistently asked both parties to concede more to one another. For one of his top advisers to trash the tentative deal is more than surprising, because it shows that the South Koreans could break ranks with the US if the final deal isn’t received well in Seoul. It’s unclear as of now if the South Korean president agrees or disagrees with his aide, though. Moon Chung-in did hedge toward the end of his public remarks. In response to another question about what might constitute a bad deal for South Korea, he said “there is no such thing as a bad deal,” indicating that as long as US forces don’t leave South Korea and negotiators don’t leave the room screaming, any diplomatic accord would prove a sign of progress between the US and North Korea. Still, a top adviser of a critical ally in the US-North Korea talks just trashed the general outline of what Trump and Kim may sign in two days. That’s worth keeping in the back of your mind as they work toward a final agreement. UPDATE: This piece has been updated to include Moon Chung-in’s emailed response to me. It has also been corrected to reflect that the moderator asked Moon about a freeze in nuclear-fuel production at Yongbyon, not the dismantlement of the facility.

This time at least, justice was not denied. A person kneels at the spot where George Floyd was killed, as people gather during the sentencing hearing of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for Floyd&#39;s murder, on Friday in Minneapolis. | Julio Cortez/AP Photo Opinion by Erin Aubry Kaplan 06/26/2021 04:13 PM EDT Link Copied Erin Aubry Kaplan is a journalist in Los Angeles and a contributing opinion writer for the New York Times. The good news is self-evident: Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced on Friday to 22-and-a-half years for the murder of George Floyd. Given the overwhelming evidence of Chauvin’s guilt, and the evident heartlessness with which he committed the act, the prison time he received for the crime should not be remarkable. But, of course, it is, because Chauvin was a white police officer who, in the course of arresting Floyd, a Black man, killed him. For most of our history, Black people getting killed or injured during encounters with white police officers was commonplace to the point of being unremarkable. Officers were rarely charged and tried or, when they were, almost never got convicted. Thanks in part to the steady rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and the graphic video footage of Floyd’s murder viewed around the world, the long racial lethargy around police killings has broken. One result was Chauvin’s trial, conviction and now sentencing. Chauvin didn’t get the 40 years sought by the prosecution, but neither did he get probation. The point is that he will suffer consequences for what he did, and this seemingly obvious outcome counts as progress. Justice, at least this time, was not denied. Because of this, there was no protest following the sentencing. And that’s progress, too. It’s worth pausing to mark the muted reaction to this moment — it is, if not exactly a first, striking nonetheless. The calm that’s greeted the Chauvin sentencing stands in contrast to the explosion in 1992 in the wake of the acquittal of all four Los Angeles officers who brutally beat Black motorist Rodney King, the first and most famous incident of police brutality to be captured on video. That verdict touched off historic days off civil unrest in L.A., not really because it surprised Black people but because it infuriated them. For them, the King verdict was yet another insult added to injury — literally, in King’s case — and the anger about police misconduct that had simmered for years erupted into rage. The spontaneous protests, fires and looting were a catharsis, but also a demand for change. The country did not rise to that moment. The soul-searching prompted by the ’92 unrest was ultimately overridden by a mounting fear of urban danger — drugs, violence and gangs, all attributed to Black and brown people in big cities. The desire for racial healing proved not nearly as strong as a need for increased law and order, and cops played a key role in that. For many white people, King’s beating and the exoneration of the officers were unfortunate, and even wrong, but they didn’t constitute obvious systemic racism or justify anything so drastic as defunding police departments. Indeed, change ran the other way: tougher sentencing, more prison time for nonviolent offenders, the wholesale embrace of incarceration as punitive but necessary — and seemingly unlimited. Last year, the country found itself in a very different place. The protests following Floyd’s murder in May 2020 were also angry, born of frustration. But they involved unprecedented numbers of white and other non-Black people all over the country, from large cities to small towns, who finally saw the big picture of American racism and the particular place of Black men in it. Thanks to this awakening, George Floyd immediately achieved a symbolism and a kind of heroism that Rodney King did not. Floyd was not just another Black victim of police misconduct; he was a tragedy that belonged to all of us. He was a Black person and a human being who deserved empathy, which includes justice. This shift in perspective was simple but radical, exactly the kind of change Martin Luther King Jr. stumped for his whole life but understood was elusive: a change of heart. Even as we can mark this as progress, that change of heart is only a beginning. The new recognition of the true scope of racism has led to an appropriate punishment for Chauvin, and hopefully to some measure of peace for Floyd’s family. But the grief for his murder, and anxiety about similar deaths in the future, lingers. Even as they laud this rare conviction of a cop, everyone from the prosecutors in Minneapolis to police reform advocates worry that police brutality will continue rather than abate, and that convictions like Chauvin’s will remain rare. And, of course, nothing will bring back George Floyd. “Truth be told, I don’t think any sentence would be enough,” Shareeduh Tate, Floyd’s cousin, said after the sentencing. Not enough to compensate for what was done. What was done to George Floyd — those nearly 10 minutes in which Derek Chauvin could have made a different choice, as a friend of mine likes to say — that will haunt us always. The officers who savagely beat Rodney King could have chosen differently, too. It was harrowing, and maddening, watching how Chauvin made his choice in real time, because he was a cop, and because he could. But at least we will be haunted. To be haunted is to internalize the anger about Black pain that has been so often vented externally in the streets, in the wake of a beating or death or unjust verdict, because the anger had no other recourse and few takers besides Black people themselves. That, it seems, has changed for good — though the cost of the change, from 1992 to now, has been high.

Are participation trophies a good or bad thing for young athletes? Former Olympian and LA Galaxy soccer star Cobi Jones shares his thoughts.Browse All VideosFavoriteWatchlistParticipation trophies.I’m not a fan.They’re bad for kids. Bad for parents. Bad for society.Other than that, they’re okay.Don’t get me wrong. I love any kind of organized competition for kids. I lived and breathed baseball, basketball, football and soccer growing up. If there was a sport to be played, I played it. And never once did anybody ever tell me that winning was not important or that showing up was all that mattered.But today, kids get a different message. Losing? No big deal. Showing up? That deserves a trophy. Wow. What an awful thing to tell a kid. Glad my parents or coaches never said it to me. If they had, I’m sure I never would’ve become a pro soccer player.Let me tell you why.In high school, I was a good soccer player. I thought I could play soccer in college. Looking back, though, I just wasn’t good enough in those college coaches eyes.I tried out for the UCLA team as a walk-on. I made it! I was vindicated. I had arrived...on the bench. The coach hardly ever looked at me. I’m not even sure he knew my name. I know he didn't care about my feelings. I wanted to be a starter, I wanted to be a winner. Shouldn't I have been satisfied just for making the team? Of course not. That’s absurd.But isn’t that what kids are told today? You’re a winner. Even if you’re not. Even if you come in last. And we’ll give you a trophy…just for showing up, just for participating.This belief – that showing up is an accomplishment – is self-destructive. Because the pain of losing is part of what drives one to improve.The frustration of going to game after game and sitting on the bench drove me nuts. I had to practice more. I had to work harder. Or, I had to give up. And I didn’t want to give up.This taught me an important lesson: If you don’t put in the work, you won’t get ahead. And not getting ahead? Well, that feels awful. So, put in the work. Or go home.So, I put in the work. I pushed myself, not to do my best – because who can possibly know what “their best” is? – but to be better. And better.And one day, my chance came. Coach put me in the game. Not because I wanted so badly to play, but because he needed me. I played well. Well enough to start the next game where I scored a goal, and had an assist. After that I started every game.The road to victory – in sports, in business, in life – is paved with losses, painful losses. Losses that can hurt so much it’s hard to breathe. Any professional athlete or successful entrepreneur will tell you that’s true.But participation trophies, everybody-is-the-valedictorian, and let’s-all-pat-each-other-on-the-back awards communicate a different message. They tell you that losing doesn't matter – it matters. They tell you that competition is, at best, not important, and at worst, dangerous. I wonder how my soccer career would have turned out if I’d grown up with these ideas in my head.I was cut twice during the tryout period for the 1992 Olympics. My pro soccer team, the LA Galaxy, lost three times in the championship before we finally won in 2002.Guess what? I survived all these disappointments and a whole lot more. They only made victory that much sweeter.In the real world, you’re rewarded for achievement, not effort. Promotions don’t go to the employees who did their best. They go to the employees who did the best.But what if the kids can’t handle losing? What if it’s too painful? That’s the whole point. It’s your job as the adult, as the parent, to help them understand that losing – that not getting what they want – is a part of life. Nobody likes to fail, but it’s inevitable and it’s the only path, ultimately, to success.Yes, showing up and participating is important. Trying your best is important. But neither deserves a trophy. If you want one of those, go win something.I’m Cobi Jones for Prager University.Download the TranscriptExploreBrowseKidsPlaylistsPresentersCommunitiesShopManage Email PreferencesAboutOur MissionCareersFrequently Asked QuestionsPrivacy PolicyTermsContactState Disclosures990SocialFacebookYouTubeInstagramTwitterLinkedInParlerTikTokRumbleAppDownload for Apple iOSDownload for AndroidPrager University is not an accredited academic institution and does not offer certifications or diplomas.

[+] SELF X Clinton Foundation: "What Works for Women Leaders in Technology" panel, on Thursday, Oct. 29, 2015 in New York, New York. (Brian Ach/AP Images for SELF) AP Images for SELF As of January 2019, only 24 companies in the S&P 500 had CEOs that were women - that's 4.8% (Catalyst, 2019) In Emily Bazelon's New York Times article, "A Head at the Seat of the Table," Kathryn Phillips PhD described the double-bind women face in the workplace. "If they’re perceived as nice and warm and nurturing, as they’re expected to be, they don’t show what it takes to move into a leadership position. But when they take charge to get things done, they’re often seen as angrier or more aggressive than men," Phillips said. One major issue in gender bias in the workplace is the belief in stereotypes of what men and women "should be." Gender stereotypes lead to men in the workplace being deemed as "competitive" and "independent," while women in the workplace are deemed as "cooperative" (Smith et al. 2018). Leaders in an individualistic culture, such as the dominant culture in the United States, are typically defined as those that "rise above" the rest and exert a great deal of influence over others (Triandis, 2018). Therefore, women in leadership roles are viewed as not fitting in with preconceived notions of what they "should be" in the workplace (Smith, et al. 2018). Let's back up a little first. How do we as a society define "authentic leadership"? Does that contribute to the issue? The Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ), consists of the following constructs: leader self-awareness, relational transparency, internalized moral perspective, and balanced processing (Walumba, et al., 2008). Self-awareness is the ability of the leader to identify his own strengths, limitations, and impact on others; relational transparency is the ability of the leader to have open dialogue between subordinates and himself, allowing for positive and negative feedback; internalized moral perspective is the ability to hold a high standard of ethical conduct; balanced processing is the degree to which a leader elicits effective opinions prior to action (Avolio, et al., 2007). Upon examination these leadership characteristics appear to be genderless; one cannot inherently view these these characteristics as primarily male or female. Then how does gender play into the equation of communication and leadership? Is one solution making people aware of rigid views of gender roles, hoping that identification of these biases leads to the dismantling of them? When people have strong gender stereotypes, they are less likely to believe that gender disparity in the workplace is due to discrimination (Cundiff and Vescio, 2016). Do we need to directly address gender bias in workplace communication through trainings or even sanctions? Gender bias in the workplace leads to lack of communication towards women; workplace information being withheld from women; the unwritten rules of the workplace not being shared with women; and lack of face-to-face communication with women. These types of behaviors can be considered gaslighting - intentionally altering information in order to create a disadvantage. Consider that interpersonal communication can be more important than written communication, especially in regards to gender-specific topics in the workplace (Anderson, et al., 2015). When communication is weaponized against women in the workplace, it is no wonder that women are so underrepresented in leadership roles. It is when we confront these disparities in workplace communication and dismantle gender stereotypes that women will have a greater chance in obtaining leadership roles.

Erin Schaff/New York Times/AP It was pretty jarring earlier this month when the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court took the bench for the first time since the omicron surge over the holidays. All were now wearing masks. All, that is, except Justice Neil Gorsuch. What's more, Justice Sonia Sotomayor was not there at all, choosing instead to participate through a microphone setup in her chambers. Sotomayor has diabetes, a condition that puts her at high risk for serious illness, or even death, from COVID-19. She has been the only justice to wear a mask on the bench since last fall when, amid a marked decline in COVID-19 cases, the justices resumed in-person arguments for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. Now, though, the situation had changed with the omicron surge, and according to court sources, Sotomayor did not feel safe in close proximity to people who were unmasked. Chief Justice John Roberts, understanding that, in some form asked the other justices to mask up. They all did. Except Gorsuch, who, as it happens, sits next to Sotomayor on the bench. His continued refusal since then has also meant that Sotomayor has not attended the justices' weekly conference in person, joining instead by telephone. On Wednesday, Sotomayor and Gorsuch issued a statement saying that she did not ask him to wear a mask. NPR's report did not say that she did. Then, the chief justice issued a statement saying he "did not request Justice Gorsuch or any other justice to wear a mask on the bench." The NPR report said the chief justice's ask to the justices had come "in some form." NPR stands by its reporting. Gorsuch, from the beginning of his tenure, has proved a prickly justice, not exactly beloved even by his conservative soulmates on the court. At his first sitting in 2017, he sought to dominate the argument and repeatedly suggested that a complex case, involving conflicting provisions, was really very simple. "Wouldn't it be easier if we just followed the plain text of the statute?" he asked over and over. "What am I missing?" A lot, said his colleagues, both liberal and conservative. "This is unbelievably complicated," lamented conservative Justice Samuel Alito. Whoever wrote the statute must be "somebody who takes pleasure tearing the wings off flies," he said, provoking loud snickers on the bench. The court's liberals are upset Of course, anybody who regularly watches Supreme Court arguments is used to seeing some testy moments in both big and little cases. But you don't have to be a keen observer these days to see that something out of the ordinary is happening. Some of it is traceable to the new conservative supermajority, including three Trump appointees, a court that may well end up more conservative than any since the 1930s. It's a majority that has evidenced less and less respect for precedent, or the notion of deference to Congress in setting policy. So it's not surprising that the court's three liberal justices would be upset. It is the degree of the upset, though, that telegraphs something different. When the court in November seemed prepared to overturn Roe v. Wade, Justice Sotomayor had some well placed verbal jabs at the ready. Noting that 15 justices over 50 years have reaffirmed the basic framework of Roe, and only four have dissented, she asked this pointed question: "Will this institution survive the stench that this [turnaround] creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?" At oral argument, Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court's best questioners, sometimes takes a different approach. She just shuts down, rather than alienate her colleagues. Still, her anger is often palpable, the color literally draining from her face. And Justice Stephen Breyer on occasion just holds his head. Neither, however, could contain themselves 12 days ago at the argument testing the government's vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers, adopted under provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Breyer called the challengers argument "unbelievable." And Kagan pointedly observed, "This is a pandemic in which nearly a million people have died, by far the greatest public danger that this country has faced in the last century... and this is the policy that is most geared to stopping all this." Law Supreme Court blocks Biden's vaccine-or-test mandate for large private companies Conservatives are divided, too, amid frustrated ambitions There isn't a lot of love lost among the court's six conservatives either. They often agree on the outcome of a case but not the legal reasoning, with Chief Justice Roberts sometimes trying to rein in the court's most aggressive conservatives. If you watch carefully, you can see conservative eyes rolling from time to time. All of which is contrary to the picture both liberal and conservative justices like to paint for the public. Just over three years ago, Kagan and Sotomayor, speaking at Princeton University, talked about how hard all the justices work to maintain good relationships and contrasted the court in 2018 to the court in the 1940s, when the justices detested each other so much they were known as "nine scorpions in a bottle." We are not scorpions, Kagan and Sotomayor said. "I think all of us need ... to realize how precious the court's legitimacy is," said Kagan, noting that the court doesn't have an army to enforce its rulings. "The only way we get people to do what we say that they should do is because people respect us and respect out fairness," she said. Justice Clarence Thomas, perhaps the court's most conservative member, said something similar at Duquesne University in 2013. "The people at the court, in my time at least, think that the Constitution, the country ... the court is much more important than they are and they somehow keep it together to decide cases appropriately and to get along with each other in a civil way," he said. These days, however, the elbows are a lot sharper. Some of it may be attributable to COVID and the bizarre conditions under which the court has had to conduct its business, without the usual set of of full, in-person interactions. At the same time, many of the conservatives are vying for the position of intellectual leader of the conservative majority, while the chief justice privately worries about going too far too fast. There are, in addition, some long and perhaps not so buried resentments among the conservatives. Alito on occasion barely conceals his disdain for Roberts. That may stem from the way Roberts became chief justice. In 2005, the Bush White House was preparing for the retirement of the ailing Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and according to reliable sources, Alito was led to believe that he would be nominated to become chief justice. But Rehnquist did not retire at the end of the term in June, as expected. Instead Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did, and President George W. Bush, after a botched effort at naming a woman, picked Roberts to be O'Connor's successor. Then, just as Roberts' confirmation hearing was about to start, Chief Justice Rehnquist died. Bush, who had hit it off with Roberts in their interview, immediately moved Roberts up, withdrawing his nomination as associate justice and instead nominating him to be chief justice. That allowed Roberts' confirmation hearing to move forward almost on schedule and right away. And Alito was instead slotted into the now empty position to replace O'Connor, his expectation to be chief dashed into smithereens. If Rehnquist had died a month later, and Roberts had already been confirmed to replace O'Connor in the interim, perhaps Alito would in fact have been nominated to be chief justice. But that was not to be. Who is Justice Scalia's intellectual heir? Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, author of Scorpions, a book about the 1940s court, notes some big differences between the justices on that court and this one. Many of the justices on the court in the 1940s were very famous; they were household names; they were from very different professional backgrounds, both political and legal. In contrast, the justices today have had very similar careers; they were and are largely unknown to the public as individuals. And while they initially got on reasonably well, says Feldman, two things are happening to change that. One, he observes, is that conservative justices "are on the cusp of what, from their perspective, is a historic opportunity to reverse some liberal decisions that their whole movement grew out of hating, with Roe v. Wade the most famous." And the second is "that you're seeing fissures in the conservative legal movement based on its success." And linked to all this is personal ambition. Several of the conservative justices see themselves as the heir apparent, the intellectual leader of the conservative wing, taking the place of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative icon, whose work led to the rise of the conservative legal movement first off the court, and then on the court. But, as Feldman observes, Scalia referred to himself as a "fainthearted originalist" and "what he meant by that was that he was an originalist, but not if it meant overturning some of the things that have existed for a long time, like the administrative state." In short, Scalia often voted to uphold the power of Congress to delegate to agencies and experts the power to regulate public health and safety, and to protect the integrity of the marketplace. Indeed, as Harvard law professor Richard Lazarus observes. Twenty years ago, Scalia, in a unanimous opinion for the court, "rejected an argument pretty similar to" the one the six current conservatives embraced last week in essentially striking down the vaccine-or-test OSHA mandate. So, it turns out that some or all of today's conservative justices are not at all fainthearted. They are "come-what-may originalists," says Feldman, "while others are more moderate and reasonable in their exercise of originalism." Conservatives are united on hot-button issues That said, those are not the issues that grab people's attention. The issues that do are the flashpoint social issues of our times — guns, religion and abortion. And on those, Feldman maintains, "The conservatives are playing with fire." In recent decades, the court has built its legitimacy on a certain degree of moderation — giving the left some of what it wanted and the right some of what it wanted. The left got gay rights and gay marriage, and some limits on presidential power exercised in the name of national security. And the right got expanded religious liberty and expanded free speech, which brought with it expanded corporate spending in elections. And it got a gutted Voting Rights Act. But now "the current conservative majority is on the cusp of ending that game," Feldman believes. Politics Roe v. Wade's future is in doubt after historic arguments at Supreme Court And, he says, if the conservative majority overturns Roe v. Wade, "as it looks like it probably will, it will be doing something the Supreme Court has never done ... in its history, and that is, reverse a fundamental right that ordinary people have enjoyed for 50 years, and say, 'Whoops, ... you never really had this right at all." The court, he maintains, "has never turned back the clock of liberty in that way before." What would be the longer-term consequence of that for the court? Perhaps nothing. It certainly seems preposterous today to imagine enough votes in Congress, especially in the Senate, to expand the size of the court and allow a Democratic president to fill the new seats. And clearly President Biden doesn't want to do that. But some constitutional scholars, like Feldman, see the kind of conservative judicial activism that is unfolding as posing a danger to the court itself not too far down the road. "Abortion, guns and religion are and will always be hot-button front page topics in the United States," Feldman observes, adding that over time, those kinds of decisions "add up," and sooner than one might imagine, there can come a breaking point. "I don't think it will happen through the drip, drip drip," he says. "I think it will happen through the tsunami. But I also think that overturning Roe v. Wade ... could well turn out to be the beginning of that tsunami." Maybe yes, maybe no. But if it happens, it won't be because the court's conservatives detest each other in the same way that the justices did in the 1940s. Back then, they couldn't agree on anything because, as Feldman notes, "they hated each other." And even though they might have been able to to reach a consensus, they didn't "because the hatred was so deep." To cite just one example of how bad it was, Justice Felix Frankfurter called Justice William O. Douglas "one of the completely evil men I have ever met." And Douglas referred to the Austrian-born Frankfurter, who was Jewish, as "Der Führer" and that was during World War II.

"I think that we have someone in the White House who has no respect for the rule of law, who dislikes democracy by an incredible degree, which doesn't make him really any that much different from other billionaires or CEOs because their businesses are not democracies.

NewsEvan HurstApril 16, 2019 04:30 PM That's right, Wonkers, it is time for another post about Mayor Pete Buttigieg, because everybody is feeling the BUTT-MENTUM, and you're just along for the ride! Yesterday, we all watched Mayor Pete's official campaign announcement speech, which made everybody cry a lot or something (FULL DISCLOSURE have not watched actually). On Monday night, Buttigieg was Rachel Maddow's guest, and they talked about pretty much everything, but what was most interesting to us, from our own gay perspective, was their rather personal talk about coming out and what that means just in general, and now especially for somebody who is legit running for president of the United States. Maddow acknowledged at the beginning of the conversation that it was a bit different from other times when she's questioned candidates, because of how she herself is a lesbian and has personal experience with coming out. Maddow also noted that she and Buttigieg were both Rhodes scholars, and that she was the first openly gay American Rhodes scholar. Buttigieg, meanwhile, came out much later at 33. How did that work for him? Maddow said for her, personally, it would have killed her to stay in the closet so long. Her question, specifically, was was it hurtful to experience that much time in the closet. Like we said, it's a different conversation from the one you're going to see with any of the other candidates, or a conversation with another journalist. It's almost a moment that, if we're being honest, as a gay person, feels intensely familiar. So it's more than a little bit surreal that it's a conversation with one of the higher-polling candidates in the Democratic primary:Pete Buttigieg On Coming Out As Gay: 'You Only Get To Be One Person' | Rachel Maddow | MSNBCwww.youtube.com "It took me plenty of time to come out to myself," said Buttigieg. "I needed to not be. There's this war that breaks out inside a lot of people, when they realize they might be something they're afraid of." Behind every openly LGBT person's coming out story is a sometimes more personally significant story, of when we came out to ourselves. It might not immediately make sense as a concept for YOU CISHETS, but it's a moment of acceptance, where one travels the distance to actually being OK with it. For lucky people, that's a quick moment and happens pretty much concurrently with the initial realization that you're different. For others, it can take years. (We personally were 19 when we came out, both to ourselves and to others, after being in the closet as long as we could remember.) Holy crap, to all LGBTs reading, we are talking about this with a person running for president. Buttigieg talked about the conflict he felt as a person serving in the military and as an elected official, that weird thing many LGBT people experience where they really give a shit about what they're doing in life, and for some reason it feels like they have to choose between that thing and living authentically. Spoiler alert, it sucks. But eventually, after he was elected mayor, the moment came, he came out, he was re-elected with 80 percent of the vote, and here we are! Pete Buttigieg, who is married to Chasten, is an out gay man, people like him quite a lot, and oh yeah, he simply will not stop giving Mike Pence shit for being a gigantic bigot. As the conversation was ending, Buttigieg said, "You only get to be one person. You don't know how long you have on this earth," and added that whatever happens with his campaign, he hopes he can "make it a little easier, just by being here, for the next [LGBT] person who comes along." After the interview was over, Maddow reflected on the conversation she had just had with Buttigieg, during her handover with Lawrence O'Donnell. She specifically talked about why she, as a gay woman, wanted to talk to Buttigieg, a gay man, about his experience of the closet.

Don't you feel like you are learning things about the gays right now? If you haven't watched it yet, this all reminds us of the part of Buttigieg's announcement speech this weekend, where he talked about what he would tell the 17-year-old version of himself if he could, which, again, haven't watched, we're going by Wonkette's helpful summary: To tell him he'll be all right. More than all right. To tell him that one rainy April day, before he even turns forty, he'll wake up to headlines about whether he's rising too quickly as he becomes a top-tier contender for the American presidency. And to tell him that on that day he announces his campaign for president, he'll do it with his husband looking on. MAN, we should really watch that speech, shouldn't we! The whole Maddow interview is worth watching. In the first section, Buttigieg talks about striking the balance between advocating specific policies vs. winning the argument against Republicans on values, and how best to do both. That leads into a conversation about what in the actual hell American values are, an important conversation in this time of trying to save America from Donald Trump, particularly as Trump plays footsie with Vladimir Putin while scratch 'n' sniffing Kim Jong Un's love notes. Then they talk about the impending release of Bill Barr's redacted version of the Mueller report, with Buttigieg dispelling the notion that we're going to find out some smoking gun thing that tells everybody what a horrible piece of shit Trump is, because WE ALREADY KNOW THAT. Want more video? Here's more video of Buttigieg talking about calling for national service as part of his campaign platform, citing his experience in the Navy and what he learned there. Pete Buttigieg Pushes National Service To Boost National Cohesion | Rachel Maddow | MSNBCwww.youtube.com Also Mayor Pete said he and his husband Chasten have been talking about having kids but those plans sound like they're kind of slowed down for the moment because SOME DICKHEAD is quote unquote "running for president," what a dickhead THAT dickhead sounds like, FUCKIN' DICK, THE END.

One thing she’ll have earned: the backlash from saying this.Erin Gloria RyanUpdated Feb. 26, 2019 6:44PM ET / Published Feb. 26, 2019 2:52PM ET opinionTobias Hase/GettyIvanka Trump says she opposes the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez-spearheaded Green New Deal because she feels, deep down, that people prefer to earn money rather than having it given to them. At a certain point, one has to wonder if she’s doing this on purpose, or if she’s really so far up her own ass that she’s tasting her Skinny Vanilla Lattes twice. The First Daughter’s comments came during an interview with Fox News’ Steve Hilton, which will air in its entirety on Sunday. Trump believes that the Green New Deal will fail because people don’t want a higher minimum wage or a jobs guarantee. “I don’t think Americans, in their heart, want to be given something,” she whisper-sang at Hilton. Ivanka, why do you keep making me do this? I’m tired, Ivanka. Ivanka Trump hasn’t earned a thing in her life except a permanent ban from the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, and maybe by the end of her father’s term, lifetime VIP status at Cracker Barrel. If I had to venture a guess, I’d say Ivanka’s targeting of AOC and the Green New Deal is part of a broader Republican strategy to seize upon the “socialist” part of the New York representative’s democratic socialist ties. Socialist policies—universal healthcare, a higher minimum wage, universal childcare, subsidized green infrastructure projects—work just fine in plenty of other places and are more popular stateside now than they’ve been in decades, but if we try anything that even hints at wealth redistribution, the reasoning goes, we’re proposing that old ladies stand in a line to wait for bread and children eat rats. We so much as agree that we are collectively responsible for each other’s well-being and we’re basically Venezuela. It’s kindergarten-level political apples-and-oranges, but right now, it’s all they’ve got. “Ivanka, like her father and siblings, was born on third base and thinks she invented baseball.” What’s puzzling to me is why Ivanka would think “people prefer to earn their own money” is her way to make a smooth landing on this bullshit-slick of a talking point. Ivanka is the poster child for why wealth should be redistributed in this country. The legacy rich did not earn the means that enable them to oppress and take from those who actually work. Ivanka, like her father and siblings, was born on third base and thinks she invented baseball. Ivanka Trump, heiress to millions of dollars whose own father was handed millions of dollars, who rose through Washington, D.C. buoyed by the unearned power of nepotism, believes other people, in their hearts, want to earn their own money. Ivanka Trump, whose own book is filled with page-filling quotes attributed to other people, thinks the rest of us ought to be makers, not takers. Ivanka Trump, beneficiary of sweatshop labor, believes hard work should be rewarded. Ivanka Trump, a high-level White House advisor who whines and ducks behind her status as a child of her boss when journalists ask her tough questions. Ivanka Fucking Trump, who graduated from Penn despite being incapable of correctly using the word “otherwise,” with some wise words on the value of labor and merit. If I am to take Ivanka Trump’s latest ejaculation of blithe stupidity seriously—and for the purposes of this column, sure, why not?—then I can only conclude that she is troubled by her unearned status, and that she plans to donate her entire inheritance to Americans whose labor was stolen from them. Perhaps a reparations fund for descendants of the slaves who built this country. Maybe something more modern, like restitution for women who were paid less than their male counterparts for performing the same jobs. (Ivanka loves women, right? That’s her whole thing!) How about the legal bills for undocumented people formerly employed by her family’s country club, who now find themselves at the mercy of the immigration system? Since she prefers earning her own money, deep in her heart, she could also consider donating her unearned fortune back to her father, who could use his also-unearned fortune to pay the many contractors he stiffed on construction projects. I’m sure there are plenty more people whose uncompensated labor has benefited Ivanka Trump who would really enjoy being paid. Tapping a person whose entire life was built on work she didn’t do to serve as the spokeswoman for the heart of the American worker is rabidly idiotic. But whatever backlash the White House experiences from this, at least they’ve earned it. Erin Gloria Ryan@morninggloriaErin.Ryan@protonmail.comGot a tip?
